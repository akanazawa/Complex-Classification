So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. Who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in Canada and all the European in				fluence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes.		Personally, I'd like to add before I get flamed, I love the fast-paced "European" game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot. I have to say that I missed him when I was living in the States, though. He is entertaining, even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he's on.	-- 	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	         	I stand by all the misstatements that I've made.			-- Vice President Dan Quayle to Sam Donaldson, 8/17/89		Me Too -- Nick Duncan <duncan@mprgate.mpr.ca>

I can understand your anger about the German audience. I mean, it was the	Finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous	penalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a	match penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and	seconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for "delay of game"	for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3	skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans	were starting to come up strong.	I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.	If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not	able to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to	admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most	other countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the	Olympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish	spectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see	all this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best	team/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team	looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to	admit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team	to watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).	But, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as	these crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)	Germans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all	ultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a	great danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience	most of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as	a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we	just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers	corresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all	Americans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging	around beeing drunk on ferries...). 	In my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you	don't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.

Do you notice that _nobody_ on the team is willing to take charge?	A dominant defenceman would be nice....too bad Schneider got hurt.	He reminds me of Chris Chelios sometimes.  Speaking of Chelios, I 	wonder if Serge Savard feels like a moron for making that trade.	I also wish we still had Corson.		Rob Ramage on the ice is less useful than a Gatorade bottle on the 	bench.		Vincent Damphousse has decided to take a vacation, apparently.  I have	no idea why Demers is playing Denis Savard on the checking line with	Carbonneau.  Savard is skating well, and is one of the only dangerous	Canadiens in Quebec's zone with the puck.  Too bad nobody is in front	most of the time.		Do you also notice that in the defensive zone, not a single Nordique	gets knocked down?  It's disgusting.  We also have Lebeau (5'10", 172)	getting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn (6'3", 205) with no reply	from the team, except to yell for a penalty.  Dammit, Denis Savard 	threw the best (only?) Montreal hit of the night when he knocked	Sundin off-balance.  When Denis Savard is your team's enforcer, there's	big trouble someplace...		>Hextall made some good saves but	>really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 3	>& could have had 5, plus another 4 in 2nd.		Aside from that second goal, Roy did stand on his head.  The third 	period at least provided something to look forward to.  Habs won the	period, IMO, and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a	couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game	had started at 7:30.  Hopefully they play that way at home.  Roy made 	the saves (we'll ignore that second goal), so now it's up to the team.			--	dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca			P.S.

				Come on Boston, where the hell are you? Seven wins in a row and what, choke?		I'd much rather see the Bruins in the Wales Conference finals vs. Pitt than	Buffalo or Quebec, if only because it would be more interesting.  Not that	Buffalo or Quebec can't put up a good fight, but I'd much more enjoy a 7-0	pasteing of the Bruins than the Devils.  You have to feel for Terrerri(sp?).		Ah, well, maybe the Devils will pull it out, or maybe the Pens will lose in	the second round, but if not, I hope the Bruins are there to meet them.

	I would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal	and save percentage numbers for me, so I can put these stats on the archive	site.  Contact me by mail if you want to volunteer.		Here are the team goalie stats as of: Wed Apr 21 09:09:38 CST 1993		These stats include games up to and including the Sunday previous to the date	listed above.  They have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper	every Tuesday.  They don't print shots and save percentage numbers, so those	are not verified.  		If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, let me know.

Felix Potvin is a great goalie.  Besides,	I thought that the Leafs could only protect goalie in the up-coming	expansion draft.  If so, then it's better to get rid of one good	goalie and get a good forward in return.

I know it happened in	Buffalo, but I can't tell you against whom.		Krupp was defending an opposing attacker charging the net.		Malarchuk became the fourth goalie (behind Hasek, Puppa and Draper) after	suffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.  He's been playing in San Diego	for former Sabre coach Rick Dudley.		Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaine/Turgeon trade.

		 	It was unlikely, improbable.  For the Bruins, it was the stuff of	nightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.  	   For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first three	games of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in a	best of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work this	time.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.	   On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home ice	advantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  It	wasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked.	   John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as starting	goaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday.	Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on	the powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box.	LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two was	Khmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabres	stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik and	Hannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on a	shot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and Bob	Sweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split of	penalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski get	his first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes	later, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tied	the game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime.	Last year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweet	revenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on a	tip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime.	Both teams finished with 34 shots.  	        Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.	        Referee--Rob Shick.		clutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic	again.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and instead	flung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea	to Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've ever	heard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I was	only five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and no	one took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview,	noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd was	too loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter, as	most of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylev	didn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't	skate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each	were out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey.  When asked in	an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he	responed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than	that, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress).  The	interviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English, he	must not understand playoffs.

Well, the "jettison for youth fast" strategy was his.

From all indications, it wasn't the "major" factor, but the "last straw".	There were personality conflicts among Shark management, and disagreements	over how personnel were going to be handled (not just who was being traded	vs. kept, but who was being sent to KC. What Ferriera did, if rumors are	right, was not always what the folks behind the bench wanted or needed).		>I'm inclined to take exactly the opposite view:  they should have kept	>him...he's obviously the luckiest man in hockey!		I think if they'd kept Ferriera, they would have lost some of their other	management staff. Depending on which sources you trust, we might have lost	Grillo AND Lombardi AND Murdoch over the summer. Frankly, I want to keep	those three. (we may well ahve also lost Kingston, which, of course, is now	a moot point). 		The Sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly	consensual and cooperative. Ferriera wanted to run things his way. There	were conflicts. Ferriera lost. That says nothing about his skills or	accomplishments -- at that level, a lot is personality and politics. 		I think he did some good things for the Sharks, but that he never fit in as	a "Shark person". I hope he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams down in	Anaheim, too, because it'll be good for hockey.

Tod spent a year playing in Russia and played with or against some of	the Russian players who have just entered the NHL in the last two years.	He wrote a book on his experiences called "Behind the Red Line" (check it	out!) and appeared on the Letterman show to talk about them.		-- Mike 		read Tod's book. I wanted to dig the book out to double check, but 	realized I lent it to a friend, and he hasn't returned the book yet! 	(Just wait 'til I get a hold of him...)

	During the first three games of the Pens-Devils series, I have been	impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens.  Jagr,	MacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch.  But, one	element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman.		Despite Brooks' lunatic comments, and despite the Devils' line changing	adantage in last night's game, Bowman has been able to keep his cool and	keep the Devils in the dark.  Granted, the hell-dwellers had the Pens	bottled up for a while last night, but Bowman was eventually able to	configure his line-up to get the job done.  His ability to throw out new	looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible.		Bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an	individual basis.  Last night, for instance, he realized that the speed	of Jagr, Straka, and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance.  As	a result, Straka received many more shifts than average; Jagr played	almost the entire game (he was always on the puck), and MacEachern	scored a goal, while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night.	His ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is	commendable, especially when a coach of such a talented team might	simply rely on the overall talent to dominate, and to bring about	success.		While no one can replace the genius and optimism of Badger Bob Johnson,	Bowman, in his own way, has made himself a permanent, though not clearly	seen, mark in  Pittsburgh. 	
	I really feel the need for a knowledgable hockey observer to explain this year's playoffs to me. I mean, the obviously superior Toronto team with the best center and the best goalie in the league keeps losing.

Well, I agree that if you're going to stand in front of the net,	that you should expect to get hit and hacked at. In general, you	should expect to finish the game with some bruises. However,	there is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain	and discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another	player. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That	two hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of	respect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He	did not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the	slot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, he	slashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a	Leaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), I	was very disappointed.		You're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least	in his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and	for that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that's	why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about	these issues). Let's hope that Felix doesn't do that again. I'd	hate to see anyone (even Dino --- although I admit I don't like	him very much) get seriously hurt from such careless (but	intentional) use of the stick.		Gary

Krupp was defending against Steve Tuttle,	of the Blues.

Malarchuk immediately fell to the ice, hands at	his neck, blood on the ice.	>	>Malarchuk became the fourth goalie (behind Hasek, Puppa and Draper) after	>suffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.

He just wasn't	diagnosed for it until he didn't sleep for ten days and decided to	have some alcohol to help him sleep.  Unfortunately, he'd just been	put on ulcer medicine a few days earlier.  It's amazing he lasted as	long as he did.  OCD sufferers stop distinguishing the line between	reality and imagination, or fail to accept that something they've	checked is OK now.  For example, an OCD sufferrer can wash his hands	over and over and still think they're dirty.  He might check the oven	ten times to be sure it's turned off.  He might see a movie about	something and automatically assume the situation is the same for his	own life.  Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes,	but still needs it.  He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCD	episode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days.  (He felt	it slowed his reflexes, so he tried to go without).  In any event, he	is alive and well and living in San Diego, while playing with the	Gulls (IHL).  		>	>Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaine/Turgeon trade.

It was speculated at the time, that	the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end	of the rink at the time (he was playing in the same end as the	ambulence is parked), he never would have survived.  Ditto, if he	were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on 	standby.		If you've seen video tape of the incident, it is amazing how much blood	there was.  It was literally spurting out all over the ice, as Clint	grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror.  		Amazingly enough, he made a full recovery, and played again in the	NHL.  He was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway,	and didn't play for too long afterward.  Some people speculated that	he just couldn't get himself back together after the incident, and I	think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward.	He did eventually get back to form, and played another year or so after	that, and then I believe he retired.

	The Isles picked one hell-of-a-time to get their first win all year after being	down after 2 periods. The Caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady	defense and getting great goaltending from Tabaracci. The Isles power play	philosophy continues to be dump-and-chase which, except for boardaholics like	Flatley, doesn't work against the Caps. I hope Al realizes this!! They have too	many talented finesse players, so why not carry the puck in and set-up??? If	last night's game is any omen, the Isles could be on their way to that ole	championship form; COMING from behind late in a game. My advice to the Caps is	to pounce on those Healy Rebounds. Flatley showed alot of heart by playing the	last period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury	suffered at the hands of Dale Hunter. Ray Ferraro has arrived just in time for	the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us Islander fans remember from an 	Italian from the past; JOHN TONELLI!!! It was Tonelli who won a similar game	against the PENS in game 5 on the 82 playoffs. The Isles scored two late third	period goals to send the game into OT tied at 3. In OT, Tonelli scored the game	winner to send the Isles to the next round. The Isles have lacked this tenacity	for years, but perhaps its BACK! It was good to see the Coliseum packed just	like the ole days!!! Good luck to the Isles the rest of the way!!!!!

When Quinn took over Vancouver- several years ago, NOT LAST YEAR, they 	regularily missed the playoffs.  I can't recall if they missed the playoffs	the year before his hiring but they probably did.

The last year before Bryan Murray took over, the Wings did not make the	playoffs.  While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques	Demers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively,	embarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the 	playoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the	Norris).		It's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before 	Quinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*--	tougher division than the Norris, also known as the "Snorris", division.	Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley	Cup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such 	powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force	in the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while	over this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was 	everybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just	to keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a	lot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.		Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good	players, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (And	no doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The	rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason	they got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the	coaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort	possible out of his team.  Then, even his coaching began to degrade.		>So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM.	>Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray.		There are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings	wise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which	I outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with	at the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player	cannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I'm sure everyone	reading this will agree.  		We'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they	face each other in the conference final (assuming they don't get knocked out,	like last year).		>Gregmeister		--Randy

		    The tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules.  Overtime time games	    that are not shown?  What the hell kind of shit is this?  If that would	    have happened to the Flyers(if they were in the damn playoffs to begin	    with) while I was watching, I would have gone throught the roof!		    However, everybody is getting pissed off at ESPN, but they are not the	    ones to blame.  They have prior contracts that they just can't simply break	    whenever they want to.  The N.H.L. is to blame.  When they signed the	    deal with ESPN, they had to know of this.  They had to know shit like this	    would happen since they wouldn't have complete priority.  The N.H.L.	    should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at ESPN.  How can the	    N.H.L. do this to its fans? How dare they.  We are the ones that make the	    damn league exist and they can't even televise complete playoff games for us to	    watch!  They more I write about this, the more pissed off I get.  We must	    let the N.H.L. know that  we expect a little better than this.  If anybody	    out there knows how to go about doing this, let me and everybody else know.		    Well I had to get that off my chest and while I'm at it....		    Mario is the Michael Jordan of hockey.  All that fucker has to do is fall	    on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 2.  Last night in the	    3rd game between NJ and Pitt, he was being pushed while skating across the	    front of the goal while trying to get a shot off.  The guy on him was	    doing a good job, so he got off a weak shot, but then he decided to fall	    to the ice. Then the fucking ref(Van Helloamend?) called the guy for	    holding.  They replayed the play, and my roomate(who is clueless about	    hockey) wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call, because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player	    had both hands on his stick, and no, he did not trip him.  It is simple,	    Mario gets touched, he falls to the ice, automatic 2.  But the thing that	    really pissed me off is, Pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal, I don't remember,	    on the resulting PP and	    eventually won 4-3.  His diving/calls makes a HUGE difference in the	    outcome of a game.		    They gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking	    obvious. That is not hockey.  It allows inferior players to bring down the	level of the better players, and allows inferior teams to beat better ones.	This has pissed me off for many years now, and it has improved somewhat.	However, during the playoffs and 3rd periods, the damn refs must misplace	their balls, because they sure don't make any calls that show that they got	any.

I think a compromise would work; namely honouring personages in 	Conference names, and using geographical references in the divisional 	names.  Although I still do not think the move will draw fans to the	game; IMO it's a cosmetic change that Bettman and the owners _hope_ 	will have an effect.

	Bleep! Bleep! Bleep!  The Bruins lost AGAIN in O.T.  I can't stand it!		Aside from frustrated ravings, I must give Buffalo credit: they are making good 	on most of their scoring opportunities, and are playing great defense.  Boston	players can't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net	except for on rare occasions.  The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent	job clearing away rebounds.  Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed	but he's also getting plenty of help.	Boston has been playing rather well (better than would be indicated by the 	series score of 3-0) but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the 	game.  As a result, Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period	2 goals down.  This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single	game (the outlook for the Bruin's advancement to the second round are quite	bleak).  IMHO, the Bruins NEED to score first.  If they can do that, they have	an excellent chance of winning, since they have outplayed the Sabres in the 	2nd and 3rd periods.		(The scary thing is that I'll be going to grad school in Buffalo next year.	   I'll never cheer for the Sabres...

		Wow, this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team, Boston.	Which Sweeney you ask...well, of course Bob Sweeney, the one that Boston	let Buffalo get a hold of (they still have 2 Sweeneys which makes things	slightly confusing).  Game winner in OT in game 1, and another	BIG goal (seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is why	Grant has 5 rings!!!) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd.  Yes, Neely countered	a minute later, but hadn't this course of Buffalo going ahead after being	tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities, I	think Boston would have notched their first win of the series.		Well, the Sabres haven't made it to the end of this series yet, but	I certainly feel they've got Boston right were they want them...actually,	they've got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt	that would come about.  One more astronomical game by Fuhr, a few more	heroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and I	think Borque, Neely, Jouneau (sp?), and Company are gonna be swinging	a new stick (Weather is perfect for golf season) real soon.  I'm not	gonna waiger anything on this, because I've seen some really strange	things happen in both pro and college hockey.		Talking about golf...was that a hockey swing, golf swing or baseball	swing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev	deflected in for the BIG ONE?  The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was a	tesiment to Buffalo's ability to really be persistent and grind it out	in the end (something they weren't necessarily in the regular season).  The	Sabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in	the opening seconds.  I don't normally like penalties being called in	such ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT.  Finally, the Sabres	won a faceoff (they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game)	when LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.

I remember reading an article in Reader's digest many moons ago	 about a similar incident. During a minor leaque game a player neck was	 cut when the opponent he was back-checking tripped and his skakes	 flew up. In this case the victim's mask proved a hinderance since	 his face was protected and so he didn't bother with the	 usually instinctive reaction to protect his face/neck.

However, I am completely and profoundly ignorant when it	comes to hockey equipment.  I've checked out local stores and looked	at catalogs, but I was hoping to solicit opinions/suggestions before	actually plunking down any money.  Having played football in high	school and college I at least have that equipment as a basis for	comparison.  But for example what are the advantages/disadvantages to	different kinds of shoulder pads and pants/girdles?  Are there any	notoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles?  etc.  So any suggestions	or comments would be greatly appreciated.

With two channels, SCNY and SCA,	late-finishing games (up to Pacific time) and overtimes elsewhere will	kick in at the end of local coverage.

My		point is that last year the Sharks had toughness that was missing		this year.  This year we had more skill, I'm all for that, but		if your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they		can't do you much good.  Whether it's a cheap shot or not you		can't let the other teams push you around.  The 1992-93 Sharks		simply got pushed around to much.  Other teams knew this.		They knew they could aggressively check the Sharks and not		pay for it.   Adding some players in the off season who will		add some toughness to the team will help insure that next		season other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously 		check our skill players, or to take cheap shots.  It doesn't		guarantee no injuries (nothing does), but it's something the		Sharks can do to reduce the number of injuries.  			mark		 just say		 #####  #     #    #    ######  #    #   #####           ____                  	#     # #     #   # #   #     # #   #   #     #            -_ --__             	#       #     #  #   #  #     # #  #    #                    \    --_          	 #####  ####### #     # ######  ###      #####                \      -_        	      # #     # ####### #   #   #  #          #                |       \       	#     # #     # #     # #    #  #   #   #     #    __________ /         \_____ 	 #####  #     # #     # #     # #    #   #####  ___________ /            \_____	______________________________________________________________________________	Mark Spiegel  spiegel@lmsc.lockheed.com   Cow Palace:108/K/8  Epicenter: ?

You can't fight,	so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when	the ref isn't looking. Ulf has brought this to a high level... Players	stuck in the past (like Neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots	are at a disadvantage in the new system.		Lets face it, A cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective	method... It is easier to hide from the refs, has a better chance of	causing injury, and you can draw people into fights that way. I don't	like it, but that's the way the league is going.		By the way, there was a rather good hit by Ulf in the last Penguin-Devil	game. Managed to hit the NJ player in the face with a stick. (Must have been a	legal hit... After all, Ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do	things like that.)		
		I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton.	Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference	next week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed	to concern the Oiler's future.		Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement	with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference,	Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that	the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to	renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.		Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,	but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.		As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly	supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market	team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems	that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans	than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if	the team does move, there is no place more deserving than	Hamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand	realignment scheme of Bettman?

Now I just hope all baseball games are rained out on ESPN so atleast	 we can get diffrent hockey games. 		  				*******************************************************************************	**   ___  ____  ____  ____  ____  **                                         **	**  /    /   / /___/ /___/ /___/  **   Experience is what makes a person     **	** /___ /___/ /___/ / \_  /   /   **   make new mistakes instead of old      **	**                                **   one.                                  **	** E-mail: cobra@chopin.udel.edu  **                                         **	**                                **                                         **	*******************************************************************************

The Detroit area picks up Hockey Night in Canada from CBC (ch 9) in	Windsor where we see Don Cherry's Coaches Corner between periods. We	also get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game. The	Grapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach	about what else: Hockey.  It's actually a pretty good show and Don	isn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were	Don got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach the	Boston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill	me in on this info?	  A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday	morning.  Personally, I've had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off	sometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave	high praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not	just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player	in the game because of that.  That's fine and I agree that Gilmour	is a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman	about a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives?	  It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from	city to city.	  Don Cherry:  'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in>	              is the best two-way player in the league today.'	 	  There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that he	basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.	  Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario	Lemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs	from the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the	Wales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about	Lemieux.  In my opinion, he is an ass.  And I won't change my opinion	if I'm in a different city.	  Sorry, if this didn't answer your question better but I just had to get	this off my chest.

		I knew, despite the lack of a full game telecast last week, it was still	too much hockey for Atlanta. Atlanta's ABC has declined to pick up any	playoff games till May9. And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16,	they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. I know this	is still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia, Alabama, etc., but	it is still pretty annoying. At least in PIttsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate.			I asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating was	not that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time	without much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoon	is usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs.	She told me that they had contractual obligations. I asked her if golf	was shown oin ABC, would contractual obligations come in the way. And how come	contractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast? She	then couldn't give me a coherent answer.			Also, I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game	attendances and that the demographics were good. I think ABC and other networks	should begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with	 thier sports programming.	I hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB 2 and complain	bitterlyt about this. Tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts	since they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation.		The lady did not seem to settle on a single reason. Sometimes, the reason	is low ratings. Then another time, she says contractual obligations.

			OK. I know I look pretty desperate on this bboard. I think I have posted	3 or 4 messages already on the issue of NHL telecats over the last few weeks.	But, hey. I am pretty desperate. What I am interested is not just a	sportsbar with multiple screens so thast I can watch the game on one	of those silent screens. Are there any hockey oriented bars in this area.	Or does some Patrick division or Adams division fan have a satellite dish?	I don't mind paying an admission fee, if necessary.

John Madden picks Gary Clark of the Redskins for his All-Madden team	a lot, over much better receivers...for much the same reasons Cherry	sings the praises of Doug Gilmour...a little guy with heart...yet one	doesn't see a string of American posts saying that John Madden has	lost his marbles.		Dick Vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or	that college with outrageous statements.		Why should Americans expect that Canada would not have such characters	in relation to our greatest passion...which is hockey?   Canadians	are very similar to Americans...culturally our sports are just hockey	and curling, whereas with Americans it is football/basketball/baseball	and bowling.		Gerald

I would argue Gerald, that Bowman is the first "modern" coach.	Bowman's Canadiens were the first NHL team to have a weight-room	in the 70s.  He is the first coach I have seen, that manipulates	the press into spreading false game plan rumours.  (During important games	listen to the pre-game interview will Bowman and compare that to	what is on the ice!)  I agree Bowman is a master of the lineups. 	Remember last year in the SC when he benched Jagr only to set him free 	in OT.  When Jagr banged in the winning goal I thought this was	trademark Bowman and also a sign of a modern coach!		I am left asking "What is a modern coach if not Bowman?"		-jake.

What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays	really well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths	is not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he	allowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you	should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third	period.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they	would not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular	goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they	are occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like	Sakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there 	are any legitimate excuses. 		>Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces 	>[description of lucky bounces.....]	>Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... 		I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a	relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result 	in a goal. 		> ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against	>an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with	>a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.		In a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as	'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty	either...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal	only, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second 	goal.		>This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,	>as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau	>were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave	>up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.		What you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the 	game was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you	could watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what	if's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final	result is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and	email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive	screwups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie	is the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is	focussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy*	goal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.		>>Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.		>And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. 		WHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally	unrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if	you're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key	saves at the key times.		>Roy is paid big money because	>that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5		For the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in	the league.

They are no better than uninformed fans.	                            	I assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think	the loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've	made any other 'derogatory comments'.  If you regard objective	(and informed, FYI) observations as derogatory, I really can't help you. 		--	dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca

Generally I agree with you. However, (1) last night ESPN cut away to Baseball	Tonite, which looks like SportsCenter tailored to baseball, and they cut	away at 7:40 pacific. That's quite a contract they have there. (2) if	ESPN couldn't deliver, they should have had a transistion plan to	let SportsChannel pick up the slack.		Nonetheless, it is ultimately the fault of the US-American public that regular	season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the U.S.	Support your team; support your game.		Somebody in r.s.h. had an excellent idea that we should write Chrysler	to thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would	consider their products. Here's an equally excellent idea, watch	baseball for 10 minutes (I know I'm asking a lot, but that's what spew	bags are for), write down who is advertising, and write them letters	complaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and	that you won't consider buying their products because of it.	-- 	Mike Eisler, mre@Eng.Sun.Com  ``Not only are they [Leafs] the best team, but	 their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than Pittsburgh's.

	  The goalie to whom you refer is Clint Malarchuk.  He was at	that time playing with the Sabres.  His team immediately prior	to that was the Washington Capitals.  While he did recover and	continue to play, I do not know his present whereabouts.	
	Just some thoughts:		I don't usually like to post simply to make fun of a player,	but this time I couldn't resist.  During the Pens-Devils game	last night, second period, I think Kevin Stevens was in the	penalty box, Nicholls punched Kjell Samuellson in the face,	then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend	himself!  All Kjell could do, at 8'7" and 355 pounds, was laugh!		And speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen, Ulf is getting a	little out of hand lately.  His cheap shots are getting more	frequent and more violent.  As everybody in the Meadowlands	except for the officials could see last night, he rammed the	butt of his stick down one of the Devil's throat.  I've always	supported the argument "he does his job by being irritating,"	but he's starting to push it over the edge IMHO.  Of course,	Holik's chop to Barrasso's neck wasn't too sportsmanlike either.	It seems that he was following the "The only way to beat the	Penguins is to injure them" philosophy.		As my Modern Drama professor pointed out to me the other day,	Jagr was stoned pretty well Tuesday night, and last night as	well, although the 30 seconds he danced around the Devils end	was pretty exciting.

Anyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to show	overtime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was going	to happen, in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even	the boring Devils game.		Overall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmly	belive that they have know respect for the fans. ie *because of contract       	obligations*, screw you ESPN.

			In the Boston area, you can hear the Rangers on WFAN and the Devils	on WABC, the Whalers on WTIC and the Red Wings on WJR. This of course is in	addition to the Bruins who are currently on WEEI but may move to WHDH because	the fools at WEEI are owned by the Celtics and thus will show them over the	Bruins every time there is a conflict.

	Can the Sabres win two more games against the Bruins?		I think game three in Buffalo will be the most important of the	series.  If the Sabres lose that game, the party will be over.  It will 	be hello next year.		The key for the remaining games in the series will be whether Fuhr can	keep up his brillliant goaltending and if Mogilny can continue skate by 	the Bruins.  He has shown demonstrated excellent speed.		Finally, the Sabres appear to have shown up for the post season.							Sabres/Bills Fan      		   	
	If I were Pat Burns I'd throw in the towel. The wings dominated every	aspect of the game.  Trying to mix up the lines is a dead end.  Murray	has too many combinations to counter with. My prediction is wings in 5.		Mark	Let's Go Wings!!!	
	  Buffalo is up 2-0 is the series with Boston, and the reason....Grant Fuhr ?	  Fuhr is playoff hungry, and he's proving once again why they call him	  money goaltender. Fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the	  league anymore (Statistically at least), but he's proving that he can	  make the big save at the right time.	  	  The Leafs should have kept Fuhr, and probably would have had a chance 	  against powerhouse Detroit. But again.......where was Andreychoke in game 1 ?		  I can see the huge smile on Gerald's face after Fuhr's performance.	 	  %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*	  *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    % 	  %   \ \_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    * 	  *    \    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    % 	  %     \    ________/                                                   *	  *      \   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        % 	  %       \  \                         Contact for the Blues             *	  *        \  \  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               % 	  %        (___)             BLUES                                       * 	  *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

Not only have I not heard of the Western Business School, or the University	of Western Ontario, I've never even wondered if there WAS a western	Ontario.

From his Topps "rookie" year (as coach) card (74-75):	"For the past couple of seasons, Don has been the highly-successful	 coach of the Rochester Americans of the AHL, but he is getting his	 first shot at an NHL job with the Bruins.  Named Coach of the Year	 in the AHL the last two years, and he aims to make the Bruins a	 rough team again, as they were a couple of years back.  Although	 he played 16 seasons of professional hockey, Don never played a	 regular-season NHL game.  He did appear in one playoff game for	 Boston in 1956-57.

			Okay... here's some gripe"ing" (?griping?... whatever).			(I live in Santa Barbara... for reference... I think)			Okay, ABC showed the Kings/Flames... fine... YAWN.			ESPN (through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game) showed the	  Red Wings/Toronto game... cool.			But I SWEAR that the advertisements all week long had said that	  ESPN would show Pitt/NJ on Tuesday and Bos/Buff on Thursday.			I raced home from work early (4:30 Pacific) to catch the game, but	  ALAS, it was the Boston/Buffalo game and then they promised that they would	  show the Pitt/NJ game on Thursday.  OVERNIGHT they changed their mind.			I didn't mind THAT MUCH.  I watched the game (hockey is MUCH better	  than NO hockey).  During the game their were no video highlights from the	  Patrick division.  What the hell was going on?  At least they should show	  video highlights of the other games (especially the NYI/Caps game that was	  so close).  My father (lives in Bowling Green, Kentucky [Bumbf*ck, Egypt])	  got to watch the Pens game on ESPN.  I just don't get it.			The biggest problem is that Buffalo or Boston fans who didn't want	  to see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 2, will turn on their TVs on Thursday	  and see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 3 instead of the Buffalo/Boston game	  3.  At least, in my case, I just had to wait 2 more days to see my game.			If I were a big Boston or Buffalo fan and I missed the game on	  Tuesday due to false advertising on the part of ESPN, I'd be mad as	  hell.			Oh well... hopefully we'll get better coverage next year OR	  SOMETHING.		Matt Coohill		P.S.  The announcers for the Buffalo/Boston were the worst that I have		ever heard (as far emotion goes).  They had the enthusiasm of		"Droopy Dog".  I hope for better on Thursday.

		In article <1993Apr20.032017.5783@wuecl.wustl.edu>, jca2@cec1.wustl.edu (Joseph	Charles Achkar) says:	>	> It was nice to see ESPN show game 1 between the Wings and Leafs since	>the Cubs and Astros got rained out.

But it looks like ESPN is going to devote most of	the coverage to the Pens.  On Tuesday night, they continued to broadcast	the Pen-Devil game even though Pittsburgh had the game well in control.	Granted they did show some "bonus" coverage of the Caps and Isles but	they cut away from the close game, which went into double ot, to update	us on the fifth goal of the rout.	Thursday was a good game even if it was the second straight game between	the pens and devils.  IMHO they should program some variety into the	telecasts.(Yes I know the game shown on saturday is between the B's and	Sabres, probably throwing a bone to us Bruin fans.)	And what about the Cambell conference?  I'd like to see a game in the	Norris or Smythe.  Why not have back to back nights of National	Hockey Night?		Just a thought.

Well, so are we, and we see it completely different than you.

	4/23/93    BLUES SHUTOUT HAWKS AGAIN, LEAD SERIES 3-0	-----------------------------------------------------	It was a great atmosphere last night at the St. Louis Arena as Joseph and	the Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game. People were	cheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the	entire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning	hours with some of the players. Here's a game summary from the St. Louis	Post-Disptach. Enjoy...		By Dave Luecking	Of The Post-Dispatch Staff:		At 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues	goalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the	the lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than	Joseph."  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to	the verge of a surprising sweep.		Joseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks	3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0	lead in the best-of-seven series.		The Blackhawks haven't scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second	period of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds,	a Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the	first round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only	two series the Blues have sweeped in their history.		The Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4,	a nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had	only two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept	Philadelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals.		The shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to	make 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the	Blackhawks couldn't touch Joseph.		Well, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at 	every opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues	were unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way.		The Blues' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry --	wore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game.	The grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and	scorers, who made the most of their opportunities.		Craig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each	period. Hull assisted on Janney's first-period power play goal after two unwise	Chicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull's goal in the second period, and	rookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final 	period.		Blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling	``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep." They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour 	``Bell-Four. Bell-Four." They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye."		Such talk is a tad premature. There's still one game left, but the Blues are	on a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels.		The Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first	minute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan	dumped Steve Smith at center ice.		Chicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray's decision to run into Joseph	backfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.		The Blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a	scare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to	Steve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threw	at him in the first period. The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph	about shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph's butterfly	style is deadly.		Rookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the	period -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two	shots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues' penalty killer twice stole the	puck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour.	 	Marouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up.	He caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican's third	penalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58,	and gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu	slashed Shanahan.		The Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it	where he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull's shot hit Belfour's right	shoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour	dived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into	the net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs.		The Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the	Blackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds	remaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by	shooting the puck into the Blues' bench.		Chris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and	Marouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues'	power play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn't return until the midway	point of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increased	the Blues' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller's crisp pass.		Try as they might, the Blackhawks couldn't get to Joseph, who stopped	everything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second period	and 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice.		Emerson's goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirected	Felsner's pass.		  %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*	  *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    % 	  %   \ \_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    * 	  *    \    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    % 	  %     \    ________/                                                   *	  *      \   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        % 	  %       \  \                         Contact for the Blues             *	  *        \  \  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               % 	  %        (___)             BLUES                                       * 	  *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

Note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various SC	and Prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local NHL owners.	When/If Cablevision VP Chuck Dolan's purchase of the Islanders goes	through, the Islanders will be back solidly in the SCNY fold (their	original owners were, and they've remained due to a lucrative TV	contract).  The Flyer Snyders own the Philadelphia SC as well as the	Prism pay channel.  There are six teams affiliated with regional SC's,	another half dozen affiliated with Prime outlets, and other locals	like HTS and NESN who have barter arrangements.  With all this	cross-ownership, I was surprised that ESPN got the deal this 	season!!		gld	--	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	Gary L.

I don't like to see stickwork,	but you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move	(I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back	of their skates when the ref isn't looking.  Makes 'em go down like a ton of	bricks, but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (I'm 	talking about hitting the blades here, not the foot).  It also makes the 	player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid	retaliation penalty.  Unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of 	position for a short time...I don't do this if a shot is likely on the short	side.  Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and with	helpful diagrams, of course).  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli (who	I have a great deal of respect for, BTW, he's not a big guy, but he plays	huge!) fall on his back a few times!  :-)		Barfly	
	"They're real and they're spectacular", the Blues shutout the Blackhawks in	consecutive playoff games. 		If the Blues sweep the Hawks on Sunday, I will launch a broom onto the ice	in the last seconds of the game. "Not that there's anything wrong with that."		Curtis Joseph has been the "master of his own domain", and the Hawks have	been shooting the puck like a bunch of "chuckers". Not even "Superman" could	play any better in goal. Joseph must have been eating his "cereal."		"It's like a sauna in here" said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and	the wild crowd at the Arena.		It was "very refreshing" to see the Blues "double-dip" the Hawks.		The Hawks goons tried to "pick" on Hull, Janney, and Joseph but the Blues	checking line "nipped" those Hawks real well.		The fat "Yoyoma" will sing on Sunday, and the Hawks will head to the "beach".

	It's about time the boys got it together!!	They were outworked and outplayed by the Wings in the first two games.	But Burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full	gear (or is that high gear?) in game 3.  Except for a 10-15 minute stretch	in the 2nd period, they outskated and outworked the Wings.  Please don't	flame this statement 'cos you know it's true!  I have to admit that 	goaltending was the key.  Potvin kept the Leafs ahead during the sleepy	stretch the Leafs went through in the 2nd.  He also kept the rebounds to a	minimum, something that cost Cheveldae 2 goals.  Clark even looked like	he had stopped moping (first star!), although I still don't know why he	was so flat in games 1 and 2.		If the Leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game	3, they may actually have a chance of winning this series (a slim chance, 	but a chance....I'm no RM.....where is he anyways? haha).

The Sabres 	are AHEAD 2 games to 0, not behind.  As a life-long Sabres fan, I am well 	aware of their ability to choke, but let's not exaggerate that.  As long as 	the Sabres win one of the next 2 games (be it game 3 OR game 4), they are 	still in good shape (ahead 3 games to 1), with game 6 to be played at 	Buffalo.  If they lose games three AND four, then start worrying.  Game 3 is 	critical for Boston, not Buffalo.				Rob Andolina	randolin@polisci.umn.edu

(even though there is a possibility either can still win their	      series, yet this ego-thrashing and arrogance-smashing by the	      underdogs (St. Louis and Buffalo) is so rewarding).	  2.

		Here we are with the Sabres up 2-0 to the Bruins and the Sabres' farm	team, the Rochester Amerks, on their way to the Calder Cup (urp!) and	what kind of hockey coverage are we getting?

This despite being	a solid seven hours plus from Long Island.

				Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 21, 1993.	The game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary, although	I think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night.		(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)		Topics	------		Don's Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter.		Episode Summary	---------------		This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don's tie. Don was	pointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn,	and Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)		Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a	hotel where he was watching the previous night's games, because of	all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter	and Fuhr.		Don began to praise Fuhr, calling him the "greatest goalie", and	said that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself.	He then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when	Fuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised "Don't Trade Fuhr!"		Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it would	be Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the	trade, but Don feels Muckler's been vindicated.		The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by	too many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver	game, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty.	Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved,	but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domi	hitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: "Its sad what	they're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed."		Next, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto.	People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke "Wendy" for not fighting.	However, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either.		This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how	banning fighting leads to more high sticking: "It's like college	hockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody.	That's why you're seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you	won't drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made	by people who don't know what's going on in hockey".		The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out	that he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip	of Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter was	taught to "play to win", which differs from today's idea of	just letting kids have fun.		At then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach's	corner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded like	one of the chipmunks.		Rating	------	Typical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but some	good quotes.		I'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.			------------------------------------------------------------------------------	   \  \                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)	    \  \                  |Department of Computing Science,	     \  \_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.	      \    ###  \     _   |---------------------------------------------------	       \___###___\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.	------------------------------------------------------------------------------	"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the	 credit..."          - U. of A.

				Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 23, 1993.	It was taken from a tape delay of a Vancouver-Winnipeg game, but	it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night. I think	it was also shown during the Calgary-LA game. 		(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)		Topics	------		Don's Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo,	Wendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.		Episode Summary	---------------		Once again, the episode started with a shot of Don's tie... This	was a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the	characters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the	Cat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.		Ron Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs	game. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players "They	won in their building, we're going to win in ours".		Don then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour	has never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he	got 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that	he gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible	for his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour	from the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk	resulting in a goal.		On the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in	the first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed	however, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells	the Leaf players "Don't let them score on you".		Ron brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal	won that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner	disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don	thought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of	instant replay.		On the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning	the series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.	Fuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for his	play.		Wendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance	during the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying	that he can't play the way he should, because of the league's	new rules. "This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its	all hack and slash." Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the	problems.		Don's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings	GM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray	was shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination	of fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article	in which Murray makes the following statements: "Players don't fight	because they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.	Instead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing	each other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there	wouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game."		Don warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to "smarten up" with	fighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used	to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,	someone gets cut every period.		Rating	------	Typical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don's opinion is supported	by Murray.		I'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.

No, and in fact, that was Ferreira's original strategy, which the troika	proceeded to simply continue to implement. There wasn't exactly a radical	shift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The	only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if	he stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been	quoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the	Ducks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper,	and he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder	whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those	injuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an	earthquake collapsed the root cellar.		>Of course, Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal	>contributions before he was fired, so it's not clear that this would have	>been different.  Besides, they *were* marginal contributors.		Let's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly	Kisio, which, if the rumors I've heard are true, was over the strong	objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do	with both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM.		Imagine, for a second, where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine	hadn't jammed.		>With or without Mullen, they weren't going to be a playoff team; what good	>does it do them to hang onto a player who'd rather be elsewhere?  		Especially an unhappy player that isn't playing as well because of it. Not	that I'd accuse Mullen of tanking, but his motivation simply wasn't there,	and that kind of thing can affect the team.		>>An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis	>>but not kept, because of his age.

I'd much rather have Skriko around than someone	like Dean Kolstad, but at that point, that wasn't the choice. And since the	choice was more one of Skriko vs. someone like John Carter, I think the	right choice was made for that time period.		-- 	 Chuq "IMHO" Von Rospach, ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com	   Member, SFWA =+= Editor, OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ 	  Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9)	  San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)

Ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical 	players for Pgh are left alone.  Ulf plays rough hockey, but only when 	other players are putting the rush on Mario or Jagr.  If you want to say anyone	on the Penguins is a cheap shot or a goon, say it's Jennings or Caufield.

Or Mario (you're not likely to see that happen) or anyone else for that matter.  It's pointless to say any one person is a cheap-shot goon,     because you'll see EVERYONE take a cheap shot now and then, especially if you'resomeone who is shadowed as much as Ulf is.		>-JPC		>-- 	>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	>John P.

		Well, partly because I, as an ardent fan of both sports, would rather	see Game 3 of the NHL playoffs than Game 3 of 162 of the MLB	season (even if the bb game involves the Red Sox).			ESPN may have had contractual obligations. I understand that part.	But it's a bit inaccurate to call us "selfish" just because we want	to watch the watch the game we love. Am I, as a baseball fan, "selfish"	when I get pissed a CBS for showing approximately one game per month?	I don't think so.		While, ESPN may have contractual obligations, we, as their consumers,	have a right to voice our displeasure with how they are serving us.	There's certainly nothing wrong with that.		    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++	    + Bri Farenell			farenebt@craft.camp.clarkson.edu   +	    + AHL, ECAC and Boston Bruins contact for rec.sport.hockey		   +	    + Adirondack Red Wings, Calder Cup Champs: '81  '86  '89  '92	   +	    + Clarkson Hockey, ECAC Tournament Champs: '66  '91  '93		   +	    + Glens Falls High Hockey, NY Division II State Champs: '90  '91       +	    + AHL fans: join the AHL mailing list: ahl-news-request@andrew.cmu.edu +	    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

How the hell can you say the guy is	a goon and justify it, with your back-assward mentality?  Saying that hurting	a player will solve anyone's problems is asinine.  New rules and a new 	referee system need to be instituted.  Right now, too many of the real goons	get away with too much, because the ref is watching the play (or supposed to be:I've seen Koharski and Van Hellemond, to name a few, with their heads up their  asses on a few calls) rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the 	play.  Even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties, it would be an	improvement.		********************************************************************************Tim Drozinski	drozinst@db.erau.edu	"Chew electric death, snarling cur!"

The	problem is that other Americans don't give a shit about hockey.  They view	it as a bunch of Canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the	shit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in	two-thirds of the US to see the stuff naturally.  On the other hand	BASEBALL is the *gasp**swoon**sigh* "NATIONAL PASTTIME".  BASEBALL is so	romanticized in the US that you are supposed to forget that other sport	exist after April 1 and before November 1.  I feel that since ESPN shows 5+	BASEBALL games a week they should be able to show an OT hockey game instead	of the opening innings of a BASEBALL game.  Hell, the game is going to last	2hrs 45mins, so what if you miss the first 1 1/2 hrs?  And I am an Indians	fan!  Show the end of what you started, then switch!  But then, I'm a	hockey fan, what do I know?  BASEBALL is the all mighty sport.		Jason	jae2001@andy.bgsu.edu	GO Whalers!  Pick well!

	Do the Isles have another defenseman to insert into the line-up besides	Pilon??? Once again, last night's STUPID penalty put the Isles in a hole for the	remainder of regulation and 2 minutes into overtime!!! Even though the Isles	nearly survived Pilon's blunder in regulation, it was the most inopportune time	for a 5-minute major penalty. Instead of confronting Cote as he came across the	blueline, Pilon backed up and swiped at Cote's nose with his stick. Al Arbour	can't be serious to think Pilon is the guy to have out there with the game on	the line??? I heard Scott LaChance is out till later in the series, but there	must be someone else!!!

	YAHOOOOOOOOO!		The Habs tied this sucker at 2 and the teams now head for Quebec	City to play game 5.  BTW, final score was Habs 3-Nords 2.		The score might be a bit misleading.  The Habs dominated the game	from the 5:00 mark of the first and then on.  The score should have	been 8-2 if it weren't for some miraculous save from a Ron Hextall	(bastard!).  He's the reason the score was as close.  Habs winning	goal was scored by Benoit Brunet at 1:07 of the 3rd.		Roy had an OK game.  He made the first save (one way or another)	and the defense was there to clear any rebounds.		This just in, ESPN radio reports that the Bruins lost 6-5 in OT.	YAHOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Those suckers got what they deserved.		Life is just great!!!! Now if my finals would go just as well!

	It's over - the Sabres came back to beat the Bruins in OT 6-5 tonight	to sweep the series. A beautiful goal by Brad May (Lafontaine set him	up while lying down on the ice) ended it. Fuhr left the game game with	an injured shoulder and Lafontaine was banged up as well; however, the	Sabres will get a week's rest so injuries should not be a problem.		Montreal edged Quebec 3-2 to square their series, which seems to be	headed for Game 7. The Habs dominated the first two periods and were	unlucky to only have a 2-2 tie after 40 minutes. However, an early	goal by Brunet in the 3rd won it.		The Islanders won their 3rd OT game of the series on a goal by Ray	Ferraro 4-3; the Caps simply collapsed after taking a 3-0 lead in the	2nd. The Isles' all-time playoff OT record is now 28-7.		- Vlad the Impaler	
	Like many others I too was watching the Caps/Isles game when the went	to the baseball game.  I too was pissed.  How could they interupt such	an important game.  I understand about contracts, but you would think they	would have a clause in the contract concerning important games!	Anyway,  us BLUES (and Hawks) fans got shafted worse!  While everyone	in the U.S. and watched the game on ABC.  However those of us who live in	the central Illinois area were subjected to watching the Arthritus(?)	Telethon.  The area that was most affected by the telecast did not get	to see the game except through HAWK VISION.  This game, had it been	televised, would have been the first home Hawks game shown in the area	since 1980.  This television BULL*&%$ has got to stop.  We are not only	being deprived of seeing games, due to skyrocketing ticket prices, but	we are also being deprived of watching them on TV.	 PEACE,	 HAMMER	 	
	Being a a BLUES fan I don't get to see much else from around the league	with the exception of Hockey Night on ESPN.  I can't get the BLUES games	where I go to school, thus I don't get to see a whole lot of other teams	play except for the Hawks.  But last night I got to catch a glimpse of	the Caps/Isles game.  It occurred to me that Turgeon is a stud on skates.	His moves are quick and brilliant.  You NY fans should be proud.	P.S. Who won the game (Caps/Isles)?	 	Peace,	Hammer	 	
	Bufflo Sabres has just finished their great four wins over Boston. All	Sabres players contribute to those great wins but those talent players	including Mogily, Fuhr, Kemhlev and Lafontin impressed me most. Their 	skills showed the art of sport, not like the garbage speech from the	coach's corner.		Go ! Make hocky popular, make hocky more exciting but less violent !

		Add Boston's WEEI-590AM as the Bruins' flagship station. You probably won't	pick it up anywhere outside of Boston since it's only a 5,000 watt	station. The Bruins also have network stations in all 6 New England	states.		This could be the Bruins' last year on 'EEI which also happens to be an	all-sports radio station. The problem is that the Bruins are not too happy	being moved over to a different station(WMEX 1150AM) whenever there	is a the same-night conflict with the NBA's Boston Celtics. This happened	28 times during the course of the regular season.(The Celtics own financially	troubled WEEI). The Bruins might resurface on WHDH 850 next year. Stay	tuned.		-PPV Mark

Great, I pulled up a chair and watched, then the first overtime period 	ended and they went back to baseball before coming back to hockey	something like 30 minutes later.

I mean, Fleury does a pretty good	job and isn't that large, but Dody is no Fleury. 		Having been witness to three or four of his fights closeup, he simply isn't	ready to fight at an NHL level (assuming that it's his role, which is ALL he	really showed us in his few games up from K.C. -- if he can pass, shoot or	skate, I never saw much of it). All he has is a right fist, which isn't bad,	but at the NHL level, the other players are smart enough to grab the thing	before he can land anything significant. Once you control that hand, he's a	fish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything	he wants to him. His entire strategy seemed to be keep the hand out of reach	until he found an opening -- and I never once saw him find an opening worth	talking about. He got neutralized quickly, and stomped on a couple of times.		Unless he shows some new tricks in camp, he'll be on my "career minor	leaguer" list. Since this was his first taste of the NHL, I expect the	Sharks gave it to him so he'd KNOW what he'd have to work on off-season. He	needs to get stronger, he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some	versatility as something else than a simply goond, because he wasn't	particularly good as a goon.		-- 	 Chuq "IMHO" Von Rospach, ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com	   Member, SFWA =+= Editor, OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ 	  Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9)	  San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)

In four of the five games Finns have played, the goalie has been chosen	the best player of the opposing team.

Anyway, quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally	(the exception of course being Canada vs. Italy).  It looks like the	goalies are getting too good.  Is this due to their equipment getting	bigger, so they cover more (their gloves, e.g. seem to be much bigger	now than they were some years ago).

Why don't you pick on 1 dimensional over-rated	type like Hull and Salami. 			-- 		cordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca 	                                           "So many morons...	rm                                                   ...and so little time."

		Caps/Isles Fans,		Anyone interested in catching the games from Nassau	Coliseum (hopefully there will be another) can catch	the game at North Carolina's Original Sports Bar in	Chapel Hill.  I'm pretty sure they carry HTS as well.	They had all three games on at the same	time last night.  This is the only place I know to	catch all of the Stanley Cup action.

			I am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack	of any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually,	I am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end	to non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they	are killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why	he is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot	fo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of	fun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final	regular season game.          PENS RULE!!!

Well that's really great Pat.  I guess since you've played a little you thereby 	qualify as an expert.  Especially since you watch all the games on t.v.  All 	that qualifies you as is a armchair quarterback or a coach potato		> Not that I condone violence, but I'll make an exception for Mario.	Pat Walker		Again just further evidence as to what kind of an expert you are.  Truly a 	stupid statement.  Mario is definately one of the best players to play the game.	I'm not saying he is the best to ever play the game, but he should come to	mind when that question is asked.  Let's face it, he just returns from 	radiation therapy with around a dozen games left, overtakes Lafontaine for the	scoring lead and then buries him!!!!  No, I guess he just got lucky.	Speaking of Lafontaine, now there's a guy who should be considered for the	Hart trophy as well, certainly one of the better players in the league this	year.

	I'm a hockey fan from way back, and maintain an interest as best I can	here in the hockey hinterlands (Oklahoma).  I'm hoping I can get a	reading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas.		I've been under the impression that Minnesota was one of, or possibly,	THE hockey state in the U.S.  So why is the team moving to a city in	Texas?  Is it that the owner is a greedy, self-serving profiteer, or	were the Stars really not making a profit?  Or was the city or whoever	owned the arena doing some price gouging?		As much as I'd like to see the NHL only a 3 hour drive from me, I	can't help but feel for the people in Minnesota, unless they truly	didn't support the team.  		Opinions, please.

The Swiss took the lead after Hakan Ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop	 pass at his own blue line, and Celio came in alone with Soderstrom and beat	 Tommy to the stick side. The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald	 was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy	 to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed	 on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest	 periods I've seen Sweden play this year.	 Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many	 times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial	 save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal	 from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way	 to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a	 nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4	 just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of	 the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole. 	 Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled	 through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,	 Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close	 range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away,	 and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.

Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just	 deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play	 goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the	 far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov.	 Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of	 the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score.	 Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya	 entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman,	 then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to	 deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck.	 The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side	 and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.	 	 Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri	 Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and	 in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes,	 and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros	 after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.		 Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game,	 7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player	 (among those Kariya with 1+6).

	Have the rules for goalies' equipment changed? It seems that e.g. glove	has become bigger and bigger all the time (and pads too), and the goalies are	wearing "over size" jerseys. Am I dreaming? If you watch old photos or	films let say about ten years back, I think the difference is quite obvious.	Who is an expert on this, please let me know. (Or have the goalies become	bigger?)

The "largest computer networks in the world" phrase is a definition of 	the Internet, not a group as a whole that she claims to represent.  As	for the business of whether or not it is large, it is large compared	to say, the number of folks on r.s.h. who are sending a letter to thank	him for changing the names, at least to this point.

It reads:		large - 1.  having more than usual power, capacity, or scope.    	        2.  exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size.		Now I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue	or how many people may have signed them.  65 people may be up there, 	thereby validating definition 2.

Thanks.  For speaking for all those who didn't feel it was important	enough to say something themselves.  		I wouldn't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the	views of a group that you belong to.

He played well when he was put into the lineup at the end of the season - Murray has to sit somebody out, though.

An agitator for sure, but Fleury never has and never	will have a fight, which seems to be what you're saying Wood is. 		The closest Fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against	Los Angeles. There was a scrum and McSorley pinched Fleury's head under his	arm. Fleury dropped his gloves and gave McSorley a weak shot to the side of the	head. McSorely, knowing a good thing when he saw one, popped Fleury one right	between the eyes. End of fight. Fleury got ten stitches for his trouble.		The only player I can ever see Theo fighting is Cliff Ronning, and even then	he'd be giving up two inches and 10-15 pounds. :-)										Alan

Not always true. In fact, in the case of Doug Gilmour, he actually praises them.		Europeans that do those things are scum in Cherry's opinion. Canadian kids	that do them are "tough, just like a real Canadian". 		Ulf Samuelsson cheap shots Mark Messier's ribs and Don wants Ulf's head. Doug	Gilmour breaks Tomas Sandstrom's arm and Don says Sandstrom had it coming. 	Methinks Don is either very confused or just a bigot. Most likely the latter.		I used to like Don Cherry.

I have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33-year old who	is obviously on the downside of his career to a 4-year $2 million contract. 	Risebrough matched the offer on King's request and Makarov has spent the last	quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain	stinks. Not to mention that he's lost a step and can no longer get himself	into position to make the nifty passes. 		I think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees	to pay his contract. He's ineffective in Calgary, but he might be able to help	a team like San Jose, with their shortage of talent. If there's no takers, and	Makarov doesn't show improvement in training camp, I think the Flames will just	bite the bullet and buy out Makarov's contract and release him. With his	current attitude, he is a detriment to the team.										Alan

While I agree that Lemieux deserves the Hart, it is far from a "no-brainer". 	The Hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team, not to the best	player in the league. So your above arguement is really worthless. 		The Pens without Mario are still a damn good hockey team. The Leafs without 	Gilmour would have been fighting Tampa Bay for the 3rd pick. 		Like I said, Mario deserves it, IMHO. But it is a very close race and a 	Gilmour victory would not surprise me.

On the other hand, I'm hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes	Fereirra made.  Imagine indeed, but then again we have the benefit of	hindsight.		Let's say that in the view of the Sharks' upper management, the attempt	to trade Kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire Feirerra.	I'm inclined to take exactly the opposite view:  they should have kept	him...he's obviously the luckiest man in hockey!  (Wonder what	sacrifice he made to the Muse of Fax?

Washington, Abe	Lincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come	from the one with David Koresh.  Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties,	but wouldn't you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team	an advantage?  I don't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this	year, whereas many others did.  Finally, Mario has NEVER complained about	being hit.  He knows it's part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an	even bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting	them up.)  Don't you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so	much in his life?		George

I'm not bored either.  Most people I know say that winning the second Cup	was better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one.	But I'm every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm	to which Susan originally referred.  Inner calm is not boredom.		As far as the arena in general being boring, well Richard's got that right.	It's been that way all season.  I attribute it to a lot of new fans who	just don't have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans.  At	last Tuesday's game, I overheard a man express surprise that a	goaltender can get an	assist.		Anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen	at any time.  I'm confident in the Pens but I'm also not stupid enough to	think for one minute that it's impossible for New Jersey to blow them out	of this series.  I doubt that will happen but it's possible.  Bored?  Uh-uh.	Spoiled?  Not in the least.  Forgot what excitement is like?  Living through	that amazing streak wasn't exciting?!  I don't take a darned thing for	granted.  God, look at Chicago...		And I see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway.  It isn't gonna	last forever and I intend to enjoy it while I can.  		Mom.

He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec.		I dunno about hat. I have friends up there on GEnie who are now saying that	Ottawa's gone soft on Daigle and is thinking hard about Pronger. Daigle has	shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked,	and after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being	stupid, he's really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a	rock. 		Also remember that a lot of teh "draft 1st" stuff comes from the assumption	he'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. It's not clear that 	Quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current	status. He's still first round, but I don't consider him a first pick lock	by any means at this point.		It's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his	signing price, since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos	suspensions.		>IMO I would	>take Kariya.  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in	>the World Championships.  Daigle didn't show this for his junior team.		>San Jose will then get Kariya.		No. Kariya won't go in the first three, for a very simple reason: he's not	leaving college, and I don't believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to	use a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two, not	when there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make	an immediate impact. San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards	Niedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team can	convince him to leave school early (which I doubt).			My cut on things as they stand today:		>Draft Order	>-----------	>1) Ottawa (60% Daigle, if not, 40% Pronger)	>2) San Jose 80% Niedermayer, unless Ottawa skips Daigle. Then it's open.		(it depends on if the Sharks can get a deal for him.

There's been rumors he was officially released right at	the end of the season when his contract expired, but I haven't seen	confirmation. It was clear from my talks with the Sharks doctors that he	wasn't going to make it for a while, and the Sharks would have to sign him	to a contract, which given his problems competing at the IHL level this	spring, doesn't make sense. 		-- 	 Chuq "IMHO" Von Rospach, ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com	   Member, SFWA =+= Editor, OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ 	  Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9)	  San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)

Ah well, another Brian Sutter team is ground into the dirt with intensity	during the regular season and then is burned out by playoff time.	Yah Fuhr has been awesome so far, but really you'd think Sutter would have	learned his lesson about pushing his team too far during the regular season.		Stuart Esrock   Bowling Green State U.

One of the main	problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything	that is going on -- more happens away from the puck than in any other	sport except maybe football and they can do iso's on football players	to be shown between plays.		The problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile,	other times you get burned.		-Tom Galvin        galvint@taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil

While it's true that the entire Sabres team played very well, I	still believe that if it wasn't for Grant Fuhr, the series would	now be tied 2-2. He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres.	In both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres	the chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series of	huge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. 	Even in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to	indicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't been	for Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was)	through the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open	up the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on	a breakaway to salt away the game).  There	is no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the	victory. 		In my opinion, Neely, Oates and Juneau played as well as	LaFontaine, Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did get	extraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev	(compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense	, IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton	playing a regular shift afterall ;-)	The difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog. 		Gary		Go Sabres!

Well, as a hockey fan, I think it's terrible. It's one thing to say, "Hey, 	let's give a hockey team to cities that don't have one!" -- that's fine. It's	entirely another to say, "Okay, let's take a team from a thriving hockey town	and move it!" 		Of course, none of us will ever know the real inside story, but	from what I know, a group of Minneapolis businessmen told Green repeatedly that	they would purchase the remaining 3600 (?) season tickets to get to the 10,000	level that Green wanted, yet he refused every time. It's pretty obvious that he	was determined to get out of Minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets	thing as an excuse. 		I was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game, and	the fans were great! People were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the	parking lot before the game, the attendance was so full as to have SRO, and the	whole atmosphere in the Centre was terrific. Minnesota IS Hockey, USA. How the	NHL can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond 	me. I only hope they get a new team soon.

Norman Green claims that he has lost money over the last three years	that he has owned the team.  When he bought the team, it seemed kind of	obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red,	before the team started making a profit again.  He gave the impression	that he was willing to do so.  He claimed two years ago that the team	needed to average only 8000+ fans per game in order to pull a profit,	but this season the team averaged 12000+ fans, despite increasd ticket	prices.  I think the team's attendence and play was clearly in an upward	trend, which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in	deciding to move.  He was even offered the many concessions he rudely	demanded, such as guaranteed season ticket sales, cheap rent at the	other two arenas in town, etc.		Oh well, I guess the bottom line is $$$.  Green wanted immediate huge	returns in Dallas, and wasn't willing to wait another year or so in MN. 	Dallas gave Green a pretty stellar deal to play there (although I feel	Minnesota's was quite reasonable), and he also has some cronies down	there as well.  All this means, is that Minnesota is without an NHL team	for a year or two.  Too bad for the NHL.		KEA

My apologies for the typo - I meant the Wings had 5 power plays in the	first period and the Leafs none.  		As well, my point isn't that the refs were biased, just that they were	calling a lot of penalties, which works to the benefit of the Wings.		Having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then	calling a bunch against the other to "make up for it" takes a lot away	from what could have been a great game.				--

As soon as the game ends, I can count to 30,	 and by that time, they've signed off the air.  No post game interviews,	 no updating of late scores, nothin'.  TSN is really putting CBC to 	 shame.  I only hope the later round coverage improves, I mean, who	 really wants to see CBC PrimeTime News instead of hockey.

At first, I	immediately thought "5 and a game" because the hit _looked_ much more severe	from an intent-to-injure perspective than it was.  After seeing the replay,	I'd say it deserved 2-4 minutes for boarding (it was careless any way you 	slice it).  If Stewart had replay, I do not think Chaisson would have gotten	5 and the game.		>In the second period, behind Potvin, Probert had the puck, and was	>going to get out front, and was _tackled!_  I couldn't believe the no-call.		This no-call was bullshit, I agree. I admire Stewart for letting them go, but	Probert *looked* *up* saying where the hell is the penalty?  I've never	seen Probert whine either (he doesn't need to).  Now, if Probie	decides to put Wendel through the boards, he's probably gone, right?		>I don't remember who (on the Leafs) touched the puck 	>on Racine's shot towards the end of the game (43.2 seconds left), but Stewart	>called it out of play, last touched by Detroit.

The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit	loss.  I picked the Leafs to win Game 3 on emotion and adrenalin, but the	Wings have no excuses for Game 4.  They should be the superior team.		The call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting his	stick in somebody's eye.  That was _the_ most dangerous stick infraction I	have seen in a long time, and everybody in the damn league _knows_ he's an	asshole when it comes to stickwork.  Four lousy minutes.  Bullshit call. 	Murray should send the tape in.  Or a Wing should hammer the living shit out	of him.		--	dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca

		Finns had to do their best last night when they played against Norway	in world champs. After two periods the score was still 0-0. This game was 	quite much similar to the first game Finland played  (against France).	The norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky, too. In the third period	Juha Riihij{rvi scored 1-0 from a rebound, the time was around 5 mins or so.	The second goal was scored by Kari Harila, who shot straight from a faceoff	behind the Nowwegian goalie. Saku Koivu, the 18-year-old center got his first	point of this tournament. Saku Koivu played very well througout the game and he	was awarded the best player of the game- prize. Despite the fact that he is	quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater. 	I think that we will hear from this guy in the future.

For so long Tommy would look up and not	have a teammate in sight.  Terreri's teammates really left him out in the	cold in the first two games.		Mom.		
	News:	=====	For the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player	remaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not 	a major part of the team. 		Trent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season	game against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has	also scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. 		Thoughts on Game 1:	==================		The Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with	Los Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing	big hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that	was the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and 	try and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky	Kings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames	conducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren	Fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren	Rychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. 		Goaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the	loss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got	very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and 	sweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off	Chris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. 		Thoughts on Game 2:	==================		The Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the	potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.	The first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary	came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring	five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. 		The deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary	dominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better	use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary	also went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up	a shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the	game with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when	they needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. 		The Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he	was leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie	Huddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. 		The game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of	Calgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for	instigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato	drew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed	30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct	for hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a	fight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and	Yawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil 	turtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at 	each other was just roughing? Where's this guy from.....)

The Oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is	that a deal is a deal.  Sather has spouted this repeatedly.  Pocklinton	has a contract with Northlands until 1999.  A deal is a deal.  Perhaps	if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets (players	such as Gretzky) and the income he has received in expansion fees with	his revenues he wouldn't be losing money.  He has admitted pulling this	money out of the Oiler franchise to put into his other businesses. 		>The Oilers have paid several times over what the Coliseum cost to	>build, and bring Edmonton prestige and recognition throughout the	>world that is essentially priceless...to nickel-and-dime the Oilers	>just so Northlands can use revenue sucked out of the Oilers to 	>subsidize their horse-racing operations is insanity.		I think that Pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization.  	I can't really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but 	he is certainly not entitled to it.  Pocklington has "sucked" revenue	out of the Oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests.	Pocklington is not to be trusted.

As soon as a player shows himself to be a competent NHL'er and expects	to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or	draft picks.			-- 		cordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca 	                                           "So many morons...	rm                                                 ...and so little time." 	
	(Detroit, April 21)		Most knowledgable observers once again watched in shock as the Detroit Red	Wings again beat the best goaltender in the world six times en route to 	another easy victory over the best team in the NHL. 		For the best goaltender in the world, Felix Potvin, six was a bad number as	he surrendered six goals and collected six minutes in penalties in reponse	to the goon tactics employed by the inferior Red Wings team.

If my powerplay was as bad as Montreal's, I'd be thanking Stewart for calling	as few penalties as possible. Quebec's powerplay is lethal and it is to their	advantage to have a penalty-filled game where they can clean up with their	superior powerplay. 		Montreal really lost that game (and game 2) because Patrick Roy is well on	his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs. The man is	truly overrated.

As long as a player is under contract to an organization, he is obligated to	play only where that organization tells him to play or gives him permission	to play. The Rangers are certainly within their rights to force Zubov and	Andersson to report to Binghampton. 		It certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the Ranger 	organization, however.

I mean, it would be more painful if the Caps were up 3-1, watching them 	tumbled when they need ONE MORE WIN to clinch the series. How many times	have they done that in their history?		1985 up 2-0 in a five game series against the Isles, lost 3 straight	1987 up 3-1 against the Isles, lost 3 straight	1992 up 3-1 against the Pens, lost 3 straight		In other words, when they were about to clinch with 3 games to go, they 	were a pitiful 2-9, the lone wins being 		1) a sweep of Philly in 1984	2) the 1990 win against the Rangers in the Patrick finals, the ONLY TIME 	they managed to get out of the division.		Actually, Saturday's blown lead wasn't anything new. We all know the Caps	are famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. Examples:		1) game 4 against the Isles, 1985, led 4-2 after two, lead series 2-1,	gave up 4 goals in the 3rd period, including the game winning goal in the	last minute. After that goal, Bobby Carpenter botched a penalty shot.	Series tied 2-2, lost game 5 a few days later.		2) game 4 against the Rangers, 1986, led series 2-1, led by 2 in the 3rd 	period, blew it. Lost game in OT and three consecutive games.		3) game 6 against Pittsurgh, 1992, led series 3-2, led by 2 in 2nd period.	Blew it and the series.		4) game 3 against Isles, 1993, series tied 1-1, led by 2 after 2. Blew it.		5) game 4 against Isles, 1993, trailed series 2-1, led by 3 in 2nd period.	Blew it again.		When they were leading by 3 in game 4, I said to myself: "if they blew this	lead, the series is OVER". They have lost all the momemtum. The Islanders	believe they can come back no matter what the score is.		I am still waiting for a Cap goalie who can carry the team, who can 	completely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear 	lives in a crucial game.		>The Admiral, a hopeless Caps fan.	>P.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders! Aurggghhhhhhhhh!	Well, some teams such have it and some teams just don't. When the Caps	were frustrated year in year out by the Islanders, I was thinking "wait	until Potvin/Bossy/Trottier/Smith retire". Well, they retired (even though	Trottier was still able to haunt the Caps on a Pens uniform), yet another	generation of Islanders were still doing the same thing.

	Hi guys....		What happened?		1.  Potvin didn't let six goals by.		2.  Wendel and Andreychuk woke up.		3.  Home ice and LOTS of yelling in the Gardens gave the Leafs			the emotional edge.		4.  Refs calls (especially last night) tended to favour Leafs.			A couple of comments:			1.  On Gilmour:  Just because the guy isn't one of the three		stars doesn't mean he was not leading the team.  Someone posted		the playoff point total and he's in something like fifth or sixth		place....plus, he walked away with the Molson cup (given for		accumulating points from the three star selection) during the		regular season.			2.  On the officiating:  I've heard gripes from both ends on this		one.  Emotions are very high in this series;  the rivalry is		one of the stronger ones I know of.  I do have to agree that the		officiating last night was pro-Leaf in general (except for whoever		missed that slash on Gilmour's hand).			3.  In general:  I STILL think Detroit has one of the better		chances vs. Pittsburgh (though I think the Leafs would do better		against the Blues....but not as well if they made it out of the		division). Problem is, I like both these teams, though I'm		supporting the Leafs on the underdog principle.  D			By the way...Gilmour tiring out is a lot like Bob Probert not			playing aggressive hockey....		By the way....I'm not any sort of expert, nor do I claim to be.			I just like watching a good matchup.				tee hee hee...ooops!		Susan

The Hart Trophy was orginally awarded in a time where people did not think	in terms of who was the "best" player, rather in terms of who was the most	valuable to the team.  And "valuable to his team" was not, and should not	be, considered synonymous with "best".  We are talking about a time when	honour and attitude, not measurable skills, were the most important assets	a player brought to his team, his league and his sport.  This was before	the onslaught of professionalism which has clearly denigrated what was 	formerly the foremost peacetime pursuit of glory.		The Hart Trophy is not a prize.  It is an honour.			-- 		cordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca 	                                           "So many morons...	rm                                                 ...and so little time." 	
	While I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory, I think it must	be realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis   	Joseph.  When a goalkeeper gets hot, there is little an opposing team can do.	Joseph should be given the entire city of St. Louis, because otherwise there 	would probably be a game 6 scheduled.  		As for the game on Sunday.  The Blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt.	One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks, looking for reasons to	give them penalties.  Second, The Blues first goal resulted because the puck	hit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear.  No linesman, no shot	for Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect.  On another of St. Louis'	goals, Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone	who didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a St. Louis player.	Finally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease.  No goalie, no way to stop the shot.		I congratulate St. Louis for beating the Hawks.  It will be a shame to see	Bryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Joseph	won't be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack.			____________________________________________________________________________	|The World Reknown Jason Boskey           | Mail: Bosk@uiuc.edu            |	|Known throughout the World as The Bosk   |"Christ, you know it ain't easy,|	|All Rights Reserved, All Lefts Enhanced  |You know how hard it can be,    |	|-----------------------------------------|The way things are goin'        |	|"Here they come spinning out of the turn"|They're gonna crucify me"       |	----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As far as Cheveldae is concerned, he is a decent goalie.  The most logical	trade in the offseason to me would be between Detroit and NY Rangers.  I'm sure	if Beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his	roots in Detroit.  He would be a valuable asset to the Wings and Perhaps the	Rangers could get a Zombo in return?  Beezer got a few good years in him and	the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play.

	  Did anyone see the Montreal - Quebec game yesterday?  It was tight right down	to the last second of the third period.  In the overtime Roy and Hextall played	like they were gods.	  Ok, so Montreal won!  They deserved it after getting their first goal in	overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick.

I	think the Bruins are doing the same exact thing the Rangers did, they're	playing too tight!!  Who's responsibility is it to check Mogilny?  He has	gotten off a number of quality shots on goal of which there are many rebounds	which are not being cleared by the B's defense.  It's too bad the B's might not	get the opportunity to play Pittsburgh again.  I would really enjoy seeing	Ulfie get beat up by Neely.  We all hate Ulfie, but would love him on are	team!!

			There was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams	no matter ow bad they are. That's bullshit. Anyone who would follow the	Pens or the Pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are	losers. It's OK to follow and be concerned about your home team. But	to  give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck	should not be required of a true fan.A  true fan would follow the team in	troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team.		When I visit PIttsburgh, I'll refuse to go to a Pirates game since I think	the management has given PIttsburgh a team which could have been much better	even if they couldn't sign Barry Bonds. Lert's say the Pens start doing to	their own team what the Oilers have done this year and what the Whalers have	done in recent years, I would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the	team. I'll still follow it and bitch about it. But I won't waste my	money on mediocre teams.		-P{ravin Ratnam

Both Vancouver and Detroit did the same thing last year:	They both won their division, they had close to the same number of points,	they both went down 3-1 in the first round of the playoffs before finally	escaping in 7 games, and they both got knocked out in the second round by	teams they should have been able to beat, with less talent.

	Here is something crossposted from the AHL mailing list:					In a discussion between me and Chris Lerch, the subject of Springfield's 	1st round upset of the Providence Bruins	came up. Chris basically raised the possibility that the AHL 	hierarchy is biased in favor of the Indians. He noted that the offices	for the league are in Spring. and many ex-Indians are working for the AHL.	Furthermore, he also informed me that back a few years ago in the Cup 	finals between Roch and Spring, that the Amerks charged favoritism by the office	and that:		"...there were little questionable things liket he AHL president and	staff attending all games with the Springfield brass, including sitting	in their box for the game in Springfield and, according to the Rochester	media, openly cheering for Springfield."		Certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this	is true. I don't know if this is anything more than whining on the	part of the Amerks (they have pulled this sort of crap against the	Wings before) but if true, this is somthing that seriously raises	questions about President Jack Butterfield's leadership.

			This comes indirectly from Al Morgani who works in the studio	for ESPN hockey.			The management of ESPN was reluctant to leave the Pitt-NJ game 	(even though the outcome was certain) because of fear of the Wash-Ny game 	going to overtime.

Were the cannucks deserving of the victory?			    Well, in my opinion the Canucks played a really strong game. I was	especially pleased by a very strong game from Linden - I think he	could be a key to success for them this year.  Defensively, they	really had a strong game.  Hardly heard Selanne's name all night.	Craven also played one of his best games since coming over.  With a	few exceptions, they really didn't let the high-flying Jets do much	high-flying.  I thought the Jets defence looked overmatched by the	Canucks forwards - they will have to improve on that if they want to	make this a series.		    In short, it was a great start!		-- 	Chris Roney  (e-mail chris_roney@sfu.ca)	
		The Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost	identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as	Vancouver outscored Winnipeg 3-2.		The pattern of the first game was repeated tonight, with the Canucks	scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period, only to stave	off a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent. The Jets	looked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the 	numbers that counted: goals.		Vancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and	left winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to 	boost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of	Bautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent	in opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.		However, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the	game to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second,	checking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged	by a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. 		The hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught	Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make	the score 2-1. 		Domi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush	to the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do 	anything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were	allowed to set up and make plays.		Both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.	McLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne	while Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous	on the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck	zone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four	checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.		A series of minor penalties at the end of the second period	resulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The	Jet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's	legs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.		The Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.	This was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected	or were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight	Winnipeg defence that were never supported.		However, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive	lapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff	in the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with	no Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the	game up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a 	backhand even though he was off balance. 		By then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it	to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing	for their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2.		Next game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games.	- 30 -

Roger,	Your responses might just exclude you from sharing your opinions,	then.  You see, the same rights Ali has to mail her letter to the NHL	are the same ones that let you post replies that mow her down like	wheat at harvest-time.  She never said she represented the entire	internet or the entire group rec.sport.hockey.  She has every right to	state her opinion along with those of the fifty or sixty or	hundred-odd folk who've agreed to allow her to list their names on the	bottom of it.  You may not agree with it.  Fine.  I really don't care	enough about the name change to care.  Your name isn't attached to it,	so why moan and complain?  If you felt her words were leading, well,	you're free to feel that way and take exception, but manners never	hurt.  I personally disagree and feel her generalizations were fine	(I have the right to think and say that, too).  Ali's under no	compunction to change a single word.  Now, while you're free to	disagree with every word she wrote, to tear apart her character is	uncalled for.  I'm posting this as a form of public reprimand.  If you	tear down Ali's integrity and character publicly, you'll get chastised	publicly in return.  Would it have been so hard to say, "Ali, please	be a bit more specific in your description, the way I've read it	indicates you're stating my view also, and that's simply not true.	I'd really like to see a disclaimer noting that you don't mean the	entire internet or the entire r.s.h. group attached to it, despite	your intent to list names at the bottom.  Thanks.  Cordially as	always," &c.  Calling her a moron and an asshole just reduces the	weight of your words and the opinions of their author in the eyes of	myself, and possibly others.  		Oh, and Ali, nice to see someone standing up for something, even if	it's not something I personally advocate.  :-)								-- 	Valerie Hammerl 	       John Sr. would lift Pat over the boards, grab 	hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu       his hand, and start running around the outside,	V085PWPZ@UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU  faster and faster.
