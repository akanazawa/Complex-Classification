So what will happen when the tv contract runs out, considering networks	have been losing money on it?  Either ticket prices will go up, or someones	salary will be cut, or perhaps the local community or merchindise could make	up the difference.  Baseball is probably facing a dramatic drop in income	very soon, and someone will suffer (probably the fans from higher ticket	prices, but definitely someone).

I suspect that a lot of the complaining about long games, especially when	it's coming from TV people, has to something to do with advertising.	Probably time "wasted" in the middle of an inning, say by a batter	stepping out of the box to fiddle with his gloves, or by a pitcher	walking around behind the mound trying to collect his thoughts, could	otherwise be sold as advertising time.

By your line of reasoning, if a guy hits into a	double play with one out and the bases loaded, there's no point in saying	that that was a bad thing to do (if his team won anyway) or speculating	on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise, so the double	play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was	eventually won or lost for unknown reasons.  After all, any speculation	involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn't.		Roger, do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the	ceiling instead?  Or are you willing to consider empirical evidence?		Teams go to the post-season when they win more games than anybody else	in their division.  If they don't make the post-season, they don't win the	Series.  Will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate	goal in ring-collecting?		If so, you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal	towards winning the division, and our disagreements come when we consider	how to win games.		In your viewpoint as expressed, winning games happens for reasons that	cannot be analyzed.  While many of us are thinking things like "Base-	runners are good, outs are bad, and therefore walks are better than	double plays with the bases loaded", you are thinking things like	"It's a team game, so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious	team dynamics that will cause the team to win today".		The result is that it becomes impossible to say *anything* about individual	players.  Perhaps Atlanta would have won the Series with me playing left	field.  After all, perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would	have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt	it.  Therefore, I could be an extremely valuable player.  Did Dave Winfield	have anything to do with the Jays' victory?  Probably, but how do you know?	If you replace him with Andres Galarraga, perhaps the Jays would have won,	perhaps they would have lost, perhaps they would have defected to Alpha	Centauri (bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed	in mid-season had Winfield been DHing for Toronto).		Was Babe Ruth a good player?  He played on some WS-winning teams, but did	he have anything to do with their success?		It is generally accepted that Ernie Banks was a good baseball player, and	Jarvis Brown and Dan Schatzeder weren't.  It seems to me that anybody who	would deny this needs to provide the proof.		Now, we have observed things about baseball over the years, both empirically	and by looking at the rulebook.  It is necessary to score more runs than	one's opponent to win the game, so it would seem important to score runs	and to prevent one's opponent from scoring.  Runs are scored while a team	is batting, and an inning ends after the third out, so it would seem that	making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good.  Players have tendencies	to hit or pitch at certain levels, and these are usually somewhat consistent	from year to year.		We do use these statistics to predict winners, and so do you.  To make	some flat predictions:  Barry Bonds will have a higher OBP+SLG than	Gene Larkin this year.  The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockies	in the standings.  The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals, but	will also give up more.  I would be astonished if any of these turned	out to be false, and, I suspect, so would you.  As a matter of fact, I	am pretty sure I can predict all the division winners this year, given	3-4 guesses per division, and this is certainly better than random	chance (and almost statistically significant).		If you will admit that the Rockies and Mariners are unlikely to meet in	the World Series, you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure	likelihoods, however fuzzy.	>	>It is impossible for all other things to be equal so your fantasy is totally	>meaningless.	>	So how about "real life"?  Person A robs a service station with two people	in it, using a .38 automatic pistol, gets $42, and is convicted and sentenced	for three years.  Person B, with a similar criminal record, robs a service	station with two people in it, using a .38 revolver, gets $42, and is	convicted.  Since they used two different types of handgun, are comparisons	totally meaningless?

Now *this* is a legitimate point.  Baseball is entertainment, and I have no	quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than	others, regardless of their win-value.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of the	slug-bunt; I doubt it's a high-percentage play, but I get a big kick out of	it.  I am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun.		Of course, this is *not* the same as claiming (as some do) that Galarraga's	inability to defer gratification isn't hurting his team because he "isn't	paid to walk" or "is an RBI guy" or whatever.		>And finally, I'd like to point out that many high OBP guys draw 	>their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike	>to them, than because they have a great "eye"		I'm not sure.  I used to think this was true, but more and more I'm becoming	convinced that it's the other way around: among players with the physical	ability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the	chance to do it a lot.		Let's break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether	they are power threats and whether they walk a lot:						Power			No Power			Patient		Frank Thomas		Brett Butler				Barry Bonds		Ozzie Smith				Mark McGwire		Craig Grebeck				Babe Ruth		Miller Huggins				Ted Williams		Billy Hamilton				Rickey Henderson	Eddie Joost				Joe Morgan		Mike Hargrove				   .			   .				   .			   .				   .			   .			Impatient	Ernie Banks		Ozzie Guillen				Dave Kingman		Shawon Dunston				Joe Carter		Andres Thomas				George Bell		Jose Lind				Kirby Puckett		Devon White		etc.		As far as I can tell, all the categories are full.  It really looks like the	two are independent.  Nobody could possibly be *afraid* of Craig Grebeck at	the plate, and yet he walks quite a lot.  Part of that, undoubtedly, is being	small of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of 	target at least 3 times out of 6.  Randy Milligan is an even better example;	he's only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season, but he walks all	over the place, despite his huge strike zone.			-- 	   David M.

While	I'm all for cutting down the number of chain-rattles and other examples	of rampant Hargroving, there was a difference here.		1)  Since time immemorial, batters have complained about calls.	So have pitchers and catchers.  Usually, nothing happens.	Unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing	complaints, Hirschbeck was acting against expectations.		2)  It's not as if Gant was "in Hirschbeck's face".  Gant said	something about the call, stepped out of the box, and turned away	from Hirschbeck.  As a hitter (alibet of little consequence, but	with a decent eye), whenever receiving the short end of the stick	on a questionable call, I'd want a moment or two out of the box,	if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on	the experience of the last pitch.  And if I was really angry	at the ump, I'd rather turn away and catch my breath than	turn to him and say something that might get me tossed,	especially at a key moment in the game.		When Gant turned away, Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant	to step into the box.  IMO, at this point in time, Hirschbeck	was determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game.	Gant wasn't dawdling; he hadn't had a chance to dawdle.  And Hirschbeck	was simply exercising a power play.  Gant resisted, as many of	us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request, and	Hirschbeck called for the pitch.  At that point, Cox came out on	the field, the pitch was thrown, and many other Braves left the	dugout.  Cox was tossed "protecting his player".  I was pleasantly	surprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game.		It's a small sample size, but based on what I saw in that game,	Mark Hirschbeck has a hair-trigger temper and a need to play	God on the field.  Not good qualities for an umpire.  I will	keep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the 	future, in order to improve my sample size.		IMO, any game where you remember the name of the umpire was	a bad game for the umpire.		Eric Roush

We cannot isolate completely, Roger, but we can make a pretty good	estimate. I won't claim to split hairs and say that we can really	measure who was better, Robby Alomar or Carlos Baerga, last year; the	difference is too close to call. But Larkin and Lee? Clemens and	Morris? The differences are too great there.		In your measure of the game, why should a team that has just won it	all ever replace a single player? Since they are now clearly "best",	how can they do better? Yet every team can always find someplace where	they beleive they can improve the team; they can always find a player	a little better than one they already have. (BTW, by my definitions,	the "best" player is the one who does the most things to help his team	win. I will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the	team, by having aptitudes one team needs more than others.)		Baseball is a team game, but it is made of individual talents. It is	absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success	or failure of his teammates, whom he did not choose (at least in most	cases.) Morris won last year because he played on a team with Joe	Carter, Robby Alomar, Tom Henke, Juan Guzman, John Olerud, et al.	Clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as	Herm Winninham, Luis Rivera, and Jeff Reardon. To define the quality	of the team as a sum of its components (as I do, albeit imperfectly)	is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the	mean quality of the team (as my reading of your arguments suggests you	do)		Clay D.

He was talking about people on the team always playing and not sitting out because of a minor injury.  He said if they do they know we'll kick their ass.  The 	time I saw in was in the afternoon and it was not bleeped.  When I saw it at	they bleeped "ass."  Mitch Williams talked about the team being a bunch of 	throwaways from other teams, and that is why they are so close.  Kruk said that	they all get along this year.

It might if you brought	your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get	to bed at a reasonable hour (in which case I'd probably decide	to take my kids to games on weekends, as many people do, or else	be prepared to leave the game early), but from what you say later	on, you don't bring your kids *or* your spouse to the game.

Seriously, I don't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts	a long time because there is good baseball being played.  However, I don't	like 3-2 games that take 3+ hours, because there's a lot of dead time going	on in that game.  I don't find anything exciting about watching batter or	pitcher wander around between pitches, or watching the catcher make a slow	walk to the mound, or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason	(Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this; the game could be way out of	reach, and he'd still be making switches for platoon advantage).  		I want to see the game, not people standing around.  I don't really enjoy	watching NFL football games in person, for example, because there's so much	dead time (you don't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch	it on television, because they're busy showing you replays).  I don't like	that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game	(the NCAA has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next	year, and they're going to a 35 second clock).  		There's also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I'm	watching them on the tube, and if I'm going there in person.  For me, going	to an A's game has become a major commitment of time, one that I'm not	willing to make that often:  the length of their games is costing the A's	revenue from me.

	The *real* way to speed up ballgames is for each home park owner to offer the	following schedule of bonuses to players on *both* teams:		   For all players who participated in the game, offer $500 for each 10	   minutes less than 3 hours the game took (i.e. if the game only took 2.5	   hours, each player gets a bonus of $1500).

		Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are 	finally moving in the right direction.  They should finish	over .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race 	in August.  However, I would take back a few moves:		1.  The Jim Abbott Trade.	    I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a	    great pitcher also.  He could win the Cy Young this year, 	    but he won't because the right side of the Yanks infield	    isn't good enough.  So why was this not a good trade?  	    JT Snow.  How many rookies have been able to step in and	    immediately have the impact that he has had so far on 	    the Angels?  I know it's early, but if you've seen this kid	    hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be 	    a tremendous player.  The Yanks should have kept him.  What	    about Mattingly, you ask?  Well - it's great that the Yanks	    have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years	    older than Snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as	    before his back injury.  It's a shame, but as a Yankee fan 	    who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I'd take 	    Snow over Mattingly at first.  The Yanks also gave up two	    promising propects with Snow for Abbott.  Besides, with	    Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling	    Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects.  I know Abbotts	    only 26, but this was too much to give up.  I believe George	    forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that	    Abbott will be a big hit in NY.  However, I'd like to see the	    Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show.		2.  Wade Boggs.	    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot.  But, his career is 	    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop	    a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?).	    Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range.  What a shame about	    Charlie Hayes, huh?		3.  Spike Owen.	    See Wade Boggs.  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri	    or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is	    going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys	    are on the down sides of their careers.		4.  Danny Tartabull.	    Yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think	    about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year.  But he	    never is.  We should expect 120 games max out of him.  Meanwhile,	    Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing	    left field!  I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists	    last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.		What I'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right	direction but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year.  They should	(at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series.  This	means getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they 	will be ready in a year or two.  		I'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner.	Certainly, the Boggs deal was all George.  It looks like George is	planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world	series now.  The veterans are always available and can be added at any	time (like Boston did this year).  Develop the young players first,	then add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep	them).  Let's all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn't dismantle	the terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee	organization back into one of respect.  I'm really afraid that he will	trade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for	example).  George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is	still one or two years away.  Have patience George and we will all	enjoy the future.  Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it's baseball	hell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time!

I don't think that it is "obvious" that "lots" of people are willing	to pay the price.  I'm sure someone out there in net-land has some	facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity	sold.  But even if the trends are relatively flat, you have to consider	what is happening on a team-by-team basis.		When the TV money dries up, franchises will be seeking to supplant the	lost revenues from alternative sources.  One of the best sources may	be ticket sales.		Example 1:	The Dodgers			The Dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales		and *probably* believe that they have the ability to raise		prices without hindering revenues.  I certainly think that is		true.		Example 2:	The Padres			They will be lucky to average 10,000 fans a game this year.		If they raise prices, less.  If they want to increase their		overall revenue base, the best thing they can do is put a		winning team on the field.  But given that won't happen (it		won't), they can probably make more money by lowering ticket		prices and running frequent promotions.  Will they do that?		I have no idea.

The only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place.	Each team's market is somewhat different, and each owner is going to	be faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those	market forces.  As a buiness manager, I would never *want* to lower my	prices, but sometimes that strategy is necessary, and sometimes it works.

	NPR this morning had an interview with Linda McCarthy (name possibly	garbled by me), an official historian for the CIA.  She has won an Emmy	for research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary (which I know from nothing	but which sounds good).  She said that among other things, Berg was the 	principal spy for the OSS (CIA's WWII precursor) spying on Axis atomic	programs, because of his physics background and language skills.  She said	that during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland, and had 	instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb	research (he concluded they were two years behind, and didn't shoot him).	(I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb	program, but I don't know how reliable this is.)  Unfortunately, NPR didn't	mention any kind of a book she's writing -- I'd certainly buy it.		(In case you're wondering about baseball relevance, Berg was a longtime	MLB backup catcher.  He was a member of an MLB All-Star team that toured	Japan in 1934, presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because	he was one of the few Americans, much less MLB players, who spoke Japanese.	Photos he took of Tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids,	according to McCarthy.)		Dave MB

Games are longer now for several reasons:  more pitching changes,	more basestealing ( and throws to first ), etc...I think a very small factor	is the increased time it takes Jose Canseco/ Deion Sanders/ [insert fancy	showboat ballplayer here] to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the	batter's box.  My impression is that sportcasters and writers have made this	an issue because they like shorter games - they get to head back to hotel	bar, eat steaks, get drunk, tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase	stewardesses around the bar.  Sure they want the game over with.  Print 	journalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games:	they have deadlines.  The ESPN guys on baseball tonight drive me crazy - they	constantly harp on this - primarily because they often have to work late 	when the game goes longer than 2:30.			Maybe I am just a ne'er-do-well with nothing better to do, but I 	would like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you.			As a parenthetical note, it seems the league is in any case fighting	a losing battle this year.  The increased offense thus far will certainly 	spoil any hopes of getting the games over with more quickly.							Nick Flynn

Take, for example, Mark	McGwire. He walked 90 times in 1993. If that's not a potential great example	of what you're talking about then I don't know what is. Now let's look at	what happens when McGwire doesn't walk:	  75% of the time he made an out.	  10% of the time he hit a single.	  5% of the time he hit a double.	  10% of the time he hit a homer.	Now, you're pitching against McGwire. Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers,	1 double, 2 singles, and 15 outs? I would. Why give him the base when you	can get him out 3 times out of 4?	Then there are guys like Alex Cole, who has a career .363 OBP even	though he's never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in	227 AB in 1990) or hit a single home run. Yep, that's right, he's	*never* hit a homer in 916 AB's through the end of 1992. Who'd be	afraid to throw a strike to him?

	Tim Shippert recently posted summaries of last year's Defensive Average	stats in terms of the Linear Weights estimated run-value of defensive	performances, compared to league average.  I've combined those with my	position-adjusted MLV numbers to come up with first-approximation total	run values for players last year.  We can use these as a springboard for	reconsideration of the MVP award.		Major caveats:  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if	San Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the	infield, that will cause some inaccuracies.  The offensive numbers are	position-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and	inflate others to be fair.  Finally, we still don't know what to do about	catchers, and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions 	of Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts.  		Having said that, there are still some surprises.  Let's look National	League first.  All numbers in total runs contributed over the season.			Player		Offense		Defense		Total			Sandberg	  44		  32		 76		Bonds		  67		   3		 70		Walker		  26		  26		 52		Justice		  14		  33		 47		Daulton	 	  44		  ??		 44+?		Larkin		  36		   4		 40		Grace		  13		  27		 40		As I see it, these are the legitimate MVP candidates from last season.	If you deflate Sandberg's offense a wee bit for playing in Wrigley, you	get essentially a dead heat.  Had Bonds been his usual defensive self, it	wouldn't have been close, but that apparently wasn't the case.  Darren	Daulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference,	and I couldn't tell you whether that's easy or impossible.  A good case 	could be made for any of Sandberg, Bonds, or Daulton as top dude.		My personal vote:  Bonds, Sandberg, Daulton, Walker, Justice.			In the American League:			Player		Offense		Defense		Total			Ventura		  22		  34		 56		Martinez	  47		  -1		 46		B. Anderson 	  21		  25		 46		Thomas		  47		  -5		 42		R. Henderson	  25		  16		 41		Raines		  17		  23		 40		Tettleton	  33		  ??		 33+?		OK, let's see a show of hands: how many of you picked Robin Ventura as top	player in the AL last year?  I certainly didn't, but I'd have a hard time	arguing against him at this point.  Yes, I know these numbers are only	approximate, but that's a big gap between him and the #2 guy.  Also, those	of you who thought Rickey Henderson stank last year are out of your minds.		Once again, there's a catcher in the ointment.  If calling a game is as	important as it might be, 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away).  TAke	a guess, folks; I don't think we can do any better than that.		My personal vote (excluding pitchers):			Ventura, Tettleton, Anderson, Martinez, Henderson.		I'm a big Frank Thomas fan, but I have to admit to a bias in favor of	balanced offensive/defensive contribution, which should have a higher	leverage in W/L record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with	negative defense.		For the record:			Carlos Baerga		  27		  5		  32		Roberto Alomar		  35		 -2		  33		Forget it; it's a wash.		Let me also take this opportunity to admit that I was grossly wrong regarding	Don Mattingly's defense this past season.  Don recovered brilliantly from his	weak '90 and '91 to end up with			Mattingly		  -1		  17		  16 runs		which is clearly an above-average first baseman.  However, it's still 18 runs	behind Mark McGwire, 26 runs behind Frank Thomas, and 7 runs behind John	Olerud.  On the other hand, it's ahead of Rafael Palmeiro, Cecil Fielder, and	every other AL first baseman not yet mentioned.		-- 	   David M.

	To encourage the great tradition of Red Sox negativism, I am having a 	contest to predict the magnitude of the Sox' fall from their current 	heights.  You must decide first, whether the Sox will be at .500 again	at any time during this year.  Then you must predict either:		(1) Their record the first time they're at .500, if they are, or		(2) Their final record, if they stay above .500 the rest of the year.		So Valentine's earlier prediction would go as "13-13" (resend it if you 	were serious, Val!).		ESPN pointed out last night that the last Sox start better than this was	in 1952, when they finished 76-78, in sixth place.		So email me your guess, either at "barring@cs.washington.edu" or directly	replying to this post.		Entries close 5 pm PDT on Wed 28 Apr 1993.		Dave MB

First, a longer game in no way suggests "more baseball to watch," unless	you include watching the grass grow as baseball.  The lengthier games	are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking	longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers	and pitching coaches.		And while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, this	is only true when they don't become extra-long.  Quickly-pitched games	can grab and hold your attention much better.

I know it's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris, but let's give credit	where credit is due.		It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris.	Last year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the 	other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge,	Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can't remember exactly).	Also, let's not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save 	the bullpen every fifth day.  If he didn't help us win the AL east, forget	about the pennent and the world series.		His run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer's (5.90 runs)	and he won only 12 games.  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of	6-5 and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as good	as he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise	control and threw the ball up there and let the batters "get themseleves out"	(I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out 	trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down.  But Morris, being a 	veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in	baseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra	(I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.		Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year, but let's not change history	to suit the present.  		BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a 	veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more	can he be embarrassed?		> 	> From where I sit, I'll let others have the excellent players - I'll	> settle for good enough and the ring :-)		ditto!		> 	> Joe Leonard	> jle@world.std.com	> 		eddie

No statistic can describe it (sorry statheads) and since there are so many	new faces in the clubhouse I think the Jays are still trying to find it.		(Insert the same comment into the Jack Morris v.

While I can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around,	Gant wasn't ordered back in the box "sooner", he was ordered back immediately.	As soon as he stepped out, Hirschbeck told him to get back in the box.	Now, Gant doesn't take a lot of walks between pitches.  The only reason	he did then because he was *very* bothered by the call.  I expect his	concentration wasn't there yet, and in a crucial situation I imagine it's	best to be as calm as possible.  Contributing factors would be Gant's	bad day at the plate, bad year at the plate, and the Braves long scoring	drought.		Now, it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is	telling you to get in there.  You know the umpire is going to do something	(call for a strike, throw you out, etc.).  Gant was wrong.		But Hirschbeck was more wrong, in my biased view.  Aside from the major chip	he seemed to have on his shoulder, what was the problem.  Gant had a reason	to want some time (disputed strike call).  Gant hadn't been wasting time all	game.  The game had been cruising along, and was just over two hours old.	The score was 1-0, with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position.	Is there *any* reason Hirschbeck couldn't, and shouldn't, cut Gant a little	slack?  For no discernible constructive reason, Hirschbeck disrupted the	game, caused a five minute delay, and materially hurt the batter in a key	situation.  Did he have a date to get to?

Well, it looks like, just as Doug trumped Tim, beating him to the net	with his defensive analyses, so Tim has gotten in ahead of me.		The way I was doing it was a little different. Being me, of course, I	used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,	and I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent	average) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I	compared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and	here's why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the	system. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above	replacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;	1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks	substantially right.		In the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I	had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of	.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is	"Billy Ripken". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the	same distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I	have set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs	are proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared	and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded	off for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:	Randy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo	Gomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)	in left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.		So, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and	fielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of	batting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55,	30 batting, 25 fielding.		Total RAR (bat/field)		1. Bonds      152 (124/28)  Ventura    124 (66/58)	2.

So the "No Power/Impatient" guys have no excuse.	The "No Power/Patient" guys are doing the right thing.		Now the "Impatient/Power" guys (how could you leave out the Big Cat?).	Would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took	more pitches?   Perhaps, but I doubt it.  If you tell Joe Carter	to go up there and take a few pitches, he will draw more walks, but	he also won't hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because	he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive.		The "Patient/Power" guys?   Joe Morgan had a small strike zone and	Rickey Henderson has "a strike zone the size of Hitler's heart" 	so they get their walks based on the small zone.		Look at the other 5 guys: Thomas, Bonds, McGwire, Ruth and Williams.  Wow!	A lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe	walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them.	The pitchers would do better (in my opinion) by just coming after	them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch, but pitchers	would rather nibble, go 2-0 or 3-1 and then get hurt.

The rule book certainly doesn't have a definiton or clarification, so it's	possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter	his throw to avoid hitting the batter-runner, then again we have interference.	You know, it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justly--if the	catcher (or the pitcher, say Rob Dibble, for example) throws toward first	and hits the runner running inside the baseline, the fielder takes the chance	of being ejected.  Therefore he probably would throw around the runner or	(your scenario) above him.		You should note that in our American Legion League, (which uses MLB rules) we	interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there IS interference	per rule 7.09.		RStimets

Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned	run, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERA	is 3.00.  To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided	by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.			ERA = (ER/IP) * 9		An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed	to a fielding error.  More specifically, if an error occurs that represented	the third out, all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs.	Earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base	when the pitcher exited the game.  Here are some examples:			If there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base.  If		an error occurs that represents the third out, all of the runs after		this error and NOT counted as earned runs.			If a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks), and leaves the game		before the inning is completed, he is responsible for the people who		were left on base.  If the those runners who were left on base score,		and the score was not a result of an error, those eraned runs are		attributed to the pitcher who left the game.		I hope this explains things for you.							Joe

How would a pitch clock work on throws to first?		Maybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make,	and award a balk if he exceeds it.  I'd have another question:  who would 	operate the pitch clock?  One of the umpires?  Add another one to the crew?		>Another pair of suggestions:	>1. Remove the Balk rule.

I think it would severely diminish the 	number of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic	ploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play (one of my personal favorites).		>2.

The base-walk allows	>the runner to "challenge" pitcher to throw over to the base.		It may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag, since the 	pitcher knows he doesn't have very many chances to pick off the runner,	so he may hurry too much.  I'd rather see runs scored as the result of 	sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness	that could result from this kind of rule.  So, I suppose there are some	disadvantages to that idea too.		>|> Baseball games take about 2:51 in the NL, and just a shade under 3 hours	>|> in the AL.  That's just too damn long.

I remember in little league, if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter's	box, even for a moment, we were automatically out.  That may be a little 	harsh for the majors, but seriously, how about putting a limit on the 	batters being able to step out, take several dozen practice swings, pound	their shoes, scratch their balls, etc.?  Maybe forcing them to stay in the	batter's box wouldn't be such a bad idea.  That could save a few minutes.			--Randy

Alright, that's enough. I've suffered with all kinds of insults (as	typical for the net), but give me a break. Galarraga is currently	batting over .400 and you guys are complaining that he isn't drawing	enough walks.  What would he have to do to please you guys, bat 1.000?

If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches	and he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen),	*THEN* I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough pitches. My comment	that "he isn't paid to walk" doesn't mean that he should have a license	to swing at bad pitches and make outs; it's more along the lines of: he's	batting .400 and leading the league in RBI's so what bloody difference	does it make if he isn't drawing  a lot of walks?

Kickoff.  1.5 minutes of commercials.	Three downs and a punt.  2 minutes of commercials.  AAAAARRRRGH!		Earlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A's, whom I	believe institutionalize slow play.  I don't mind the cat-and-mouse	game with Rickey on first;  in fact, I rather enjoy it.  Similarly	I would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first.  What	I object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first,	or when the game is a blowout.  I don't mind when the pitcher steps off 	the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation, or when a hitter	steps out of the box to regain his concentration.  What I object to	is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity.	When a game is exciting, these little delays serve as tension builders	and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game.  When the	delays happen with regularity, they become nuisances, just like the	commercial breaks in football.  		I understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to "speed up"	the games, basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move	the markers and the ball to the spots faster.  That did not address	the problem of the continuity of the game.  It may have appeased the	sponsors and the networks, but I would be amazed if it did anything	to enhance the experience of the fans.		Similary, while some 3-hour baseball games bore me to tears, those are the	ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly	long periods to get ready for each pitch.  I doubt if anyone watching	the Braves-Giants game cared about Gant stepping out.  I doubt if anyone	watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an	opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that	was present.  I would be totally opposed to any effort that would	eliminate that aspect of baseball.		On the other hand, I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful	enough to sit down with Alderson/LaRussa/Duncan and explain that they	are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games 	out the way that they do.  I sure wouldn't mind a little arm-twisting	there.				--	The Beastmaster						-- 	Mark Singer    	mss@netcom.com

	Disclaimer -- This is for fun.		In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called	"stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not	make with average effort."  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted	by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats	for the centerfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays Juan	Gonzalez would not have made."		OK, I realize that's unfair.  Juan's probably the victim of pitching staff,	fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we	replaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 55.4% out	making ability, how many extra hits would go by?		To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net	Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league	average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra 	Bases (doubles and triples let by).		Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or	DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.	I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which	should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't	take it too seriously.

How long did Viola sign for.  Three years?  I generally agree with	their policy of avoiding long-term contracts for pitchers.  But I	think they enforce it rather too strictly.

Some thoughts and facts,		1.)  Bill James is a partial owner of STATS, inc.  However he has almost	nothing to do with the day-to-day operations of the company, although he	does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name.	(The handbook, but not the scoreboard).  To the best of my knowledge, the	only things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions section	of the handbook, and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook.		2.) The debate over Elias goes way back.  Bill James' early stuff was hampered	by the fact that Elias would not give access to their stats at any price.	Project Scoresheet, and later, STATS were founded to fill this void.  You	can call STATS, and ask them for a report on just about anything in their	database, and they will provide it -- for a price, of course.  Or you could	just log into their online system and look at the data yourself.  Having	attempted to pry numbers from Elias in the past (football, not baseball), they	just don't do that.  In STATS eyes, the high ground comes from making the	information available at all.		3.)  That being said, I'm pretty dissapointed by Bill's book this year, too.	I am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers 	desire to have the book come out sooner than April.		Hope this makes things just a little bit clearer.		(Bias alert.  I am a former part-time employee of STATS.)		Noel Rappin	noel@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu

For the past year or two, the AP has been getting box	scores from STATS, Inc.  The AP representative in the press box is actually	a STATS reporter ($25 dollars a game, but free parking.  And anybody can	do it.)  The box is downloaded to STATS in Chicago, some quick error 	checking is done, and then STATS sends it to the AP.  I'm not sure where	the appreveiations come in hear.  I don't think it is at STATS's.  It may	just be a space correction by the AP sports editor that day. 		While I'm mentioning STATS reporters, they are always looking for new	people.  Especially if you live in Cleveland or Pittsburgh, you're road	to getting into the press box may be real short.  For more info, call 	STATS (708) 676-3322, and ask about the reporter network.

I couldn't agree more.  The Jays have a lot of power in their line-up. 	So far pitching has been the biggest problem.

One incident that sticks out in my mind was when Derek Bell ran back out on	to the feild after the Jays had won the division and all the players were	back in the clubhouse.  Bell ran around the field with his arms in the air,	waving a big towel over his head.  He looked like a big jerk, especially	when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole	season.  The next day, Winfield and Carter somehow got the keys to Bell's	Jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started.  The stadium	announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for Bell's	jeep.  Bell really freaked out. I don't think Bell was to popular after that.		I think that Jackson might be trying a little too hard right now.  He's known	for being a great outfielder,  and he's not the only Blue Jay who has been	booting balls and playing generally awful.			andrew		-- 	.....................................................................

		As the heading indicates, it is impossible for me to fathom why Barry is not	batting 4th for the Giants behind Will Clark.  Barry is such an awesome and	consistent hitter -- definitely the best in the National League.  IMHO, to 	have Williams, a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting	4th ahead of Bonds is simply an injustice to the Giants and fans of the	Giants.

	Tim Belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as Cincinnati won 	their second straight 5-0.  Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and 	often by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some	recently rare power with their bats.		Belcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the	game progressed.  Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those	were few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while	striking out nine.  In a post game interview he said his change-up was working	for him--I should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on 	breaking balls.		Tomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch	double to lead-off batter Bip Roberts.  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and 	Barry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right.  The big guys	(Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact	they all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal	and a Tomlin wild pitch.		In fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky	start-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only	2-0.  Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was	poorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple.  Milligan would 	later score on Reggie Sanders' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead 	after 4.		The fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second	double of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the 	left field line, chasing Tomlin.  Barry later would score the final run on	Tom Prince's two-base passed ball.  		The Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the	fifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second 	being of the "bunt" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a 	foul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith "K'd" to end any Pittsburgh hope.		Pittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though:  relievers Blas Minor,	Moeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings	work.		Barry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played 	bruised his right thumb.  He was taken to the hospital for "precautionary	X-rays".  Let's hope he's OK.		Cincinnati is now 4-9, still the worst record in the majors, but with the	two wins they may be looking at  moving out of the cellar!	Pittsburgh is now 7-6.		*********REDS FANS***************************	If you would like to receive this report on a 	semi-daily basis (as often as I write it), 	send me your e-mail address and I'll put you 	on the list.

He was making	a protest about the lack of an appeal to first.  As has been	pointed out earlier, there is no appeal to first on a strike.	I can understand Gant feeling a little pressure in a two-out,	RISP, 1 - 0 game, ninth inning.  He let it get to him.  The ump	also overreacted.  Gant was stalking off, but I doubt he would	have been gone long.  Hirschbeck should have let him have a	moment to compose himself before telling him to come bat.

	Hey folks,		Saw the Giants play ball at the 'Stick Saturday, April 17.  It was the game	where Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out,	two-run homer to right to win it.  (It wasn't the game where the fans 	threw the give-away "fotoballs" onto the field in response to the homer --	too bad, huh?)		Well, the 'Stick is still cold.  The Saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it	was cold then.  I can't imagine night games in April at the 'Stick.  The	wind kicked up a little, too, and I got this idea.		At most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on	the field a lot of the time.  I propose a Kid's Clean-up Corps composed	mainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run	out on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the Toro smooths	the infield) and grab the trash.		It might not be glamorous, but at that age I probably would have given	anything to be on the field with the ballplayers.  Everybody wins here!		Whaddaya think?		Sean

He must, and I mean MUST, get fastballs to	hit...otherwise he becomes little more than Sixto Lezcano in disguise.	What I would suggest is perhaps batting Bonds, Williams, and Clark	3-4-5, the reason being that I feel Bonds' potential basestealing	abilities are wasted when he's stuck behind two slow runners.	I think the chance of getting 20-30 extra stolen bases with Bonds in the	3 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having 	Clark in the 5 spot.		Matt

Well, when you say, without Morris, you have to mention an assumed	replacement.  If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston	soft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days, then	of course the Blue Jays wouldn't have won without Morris.  If the	alternative was replacement level, then I think it would've been very	close, and yes, Morris might've made the difference.  If the alternative	was Frank Viola, the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with	Viola.		>Last year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the 	>other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge,	>Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can't remember exactly).

What happened most of the time is that	Morris fell behind, and the team came back and rescued him.  Mostly,	this is because he's a lousy 1st inning pitcher, and much better	the rest of the way.  That the team can climb out of 4-0, 5-0 holes	consistently and win them 6-5 is not to Morris' credit; it's to the	team's credit.		Furthermore, while Morris did exceed the W-L percentage that would	be projected from his runs allowed and run support, he hasn't done	this in previous years.  In fact, his W-L record in 1991 is a lot	worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed.	Do you think he just came up with this ability in 1992.		Look at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in.  Typical	Morris games.  Morris gets behind; team rescues him.  He's not	responsible for that rescue.  And in both those games, the team	just didn't rescue him enough.  Jack Morris pitched as well as he did	during much of the season in those 2 games; the offense just didn't	earn him a victory.		>BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a 	>veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more	>can he be embarrassed?		Morris is one of those guys who will reture when he can't start	anymore; he's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen.		Greg 	
	Did anyone happen to see Peter Gammons on ESPN last night?  He addressed	this exact issue, and dismissed it rather quickly.  According to Gammons,	advanced scouts are reporting that Morris' fastball and slider still have	the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability	to keep the ball hidden during his release.  Guzman and Stottlemyre have	gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a	little work with the pitching coach.  Gammons looks to see Morris back in	top form within the month.		I, on the other hand, still have my doubts.  Morris' ERA last year was	rather high for a pitcher who won 20 games.  His showing in the Series was	not surprising.  Although I'm not convinced that he's washed up, I have my	doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the	Twins in '91.									-Brian Klaff

Well, your idea of "interesting" differs from mine.  I think	batting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special	effort to get to the game very early in order to see it.  I think the	delaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are	interesting because they're attempts to gain advantage through control	of the flow and timing of the game.  Of course, the umpires can, and	should, intervene when these tactics get out of hand.  As Ryan Robbins	has pointed out, there are rules that cover this.		One of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is its	open-endedness with regard to time.  You never know if the game is going	to zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it's going to	go on until four in the morning.  Likewise, some games are action-packed,	and some games are slow and lazy.  That's fine by me.  Those folks who	want constant action should watch the games on TV so they can channel-	surf and cater to their short attention spans.		Heather	HHENDERSON@vax.clarku.edu

Joe Morgan thinks that Bonds-Clark-	Williams should be the 3-4-5 hitters.  While he believes that Clark-Bonds-	Williams is fine, he definitely is of the opinion that Bonds should hit	ahead of Williams.  I am inclined to agree with him.	Your first reason is not valid because Bonds can hit both lefties and righties	very well.  He hits lefties or righties better than any other Giant	Williams is still getting breaking balls although not as much as last season.	But, the bottom line is Bonds is a far more disciplined and more productive	hitter than Williams, and I prefer to take my chances with Bonds driving in	the 1, 2 or 3 hitters (who are expected to have high OBPs) than with Williams.	Williams would get more fastballs with Bonds on first and second base open	because of the threat of Bonds stealing.

This is *precisely* why they were considered America's team.  Even	(especially?) when they were bad, you could see most of the Braves games on	cable.

	Is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly RBI's?	This is the situation that brought the question up:		The Red Sox were up in the bottom of the 9th by a score of 5-1.  The Mariners	had the bases loaded with 1 out.  The batter hits a fly to center, which the	fielder catches.  The runner at third tags and scores without a throw.  		Now, without a judgement call (and I don't think there is one), this is an RBI	for the batter.  It seems to me that a better name for this would be "defensive	indifference", since it doesn't really matter whether the guy at third scores	at that point.  (I know, I can think of several "If the Mariners stole third	and second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a	grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and	third, he wouldn't have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and	maybe he therefore can't make the throw to first to get the last out, etc...	scenarios, too.  But does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when	you're down by 4?  If the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.)		The point is that the batter (IMO) shouldn't get "credit" (an RBI) for utterly	failing to do his job - which at this point is to get a hit or a walk, not	trade an out for one run.

	Total Baseball, which also tries to evaluate a player's total offensive	and defensive contributions, gives Barry Bonds a Total Player rating of	9.0 for 1992. Only one other player since Ruth attained that mark: Cal	Ripken for his 1984 season. Rounding out the top five offensive players	in the NL last season: Sheffield, 5.9; Sandberg, 5.8; Van Slyke, 5.3; and	Larkin, 4.7.		The top 5 offensive players in the AL in 1992 were: E. Martinez, 4.8;	Ventura, 4.8; Anderson, 4.5; R. Henderson, 4.4; and Thomas, 4.4		In short, Total Baseball says Bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons	ever in the game's history -- better than any year had by Mantle,	Mays, Williams, etc. (If you disagree, don't flame me; flame the	writers of Total Baseball.) Also, Martinez and Ventura are neck and	neck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which one	had the better year can be considered a toss-up. Thus, Total Baseball	supports your choices of Bonds and Ventura as the MVPs of 1992.				--	--------------------------	Phil Brown                |	aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |	--------------------------	
		The Phillies have won two games back to back in extra innings.  Last	night's game was hard fought.  The game in Chicago should have been a	blow out.  All in all these two games show a different Phillies team.	In past seasons they tended to always be on the short end of 1 run	games.  I don't know how many times I saw them losing by only 1 run.	If they were able to win most of those, they might have been more of	a contending team.  They are 3-0 so far in extra innings.  And of	course, they are 10-3.

	I like the Clark-WIlliams-Bonds order.	Pitchers can only walk Clark with 2 outs (unlike last year).		Williams is getting better pitches to hit with Bonds looming	in the on-deck circle.  Since Matt has a terrible batting eye,	this helps the Giants a lot.		When Bonds gets on base all by himself, he can try to steal 2nd	and then be driven in with a single by Thompson, Manwaring, or Clayton.		If you bat Bonds before the other sluggers, then you don't want	him to run because a "caught stealing" could take you out of a	big inning.		Also Bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he	is such a good base stealer (a walk is a potential double).		The only draw back is when Clark and Williams are clogging up the 	bases infront of Bonds... and I think that's a problem the 	Giants will be glad to see especially if Robby Thompson gets hot.

Brock, Coleman, and Wilson were hot-dog basestealers (also Lonnie Smith);	that seems to be a special class.

And he pitched many not-so-outstanding ballgames, too.		Jack essentially pitched a lot of .500 ball last year.  This certainly	isn't irrelevant, and iif you replace Morris with replacement level quality	the Blue Jays might not win.		Re leadership, I don't see it.  If the leadership effect is there for	a starting pitcher, you would expect to see its primary effect on the	pitching staff.  You would expect to see the rest of the staff improve.	Instead, the rest of the staff declined.		You can make a reasonable argument for Winfield providing leadership;	the offense picked up considerably from its effectiveness the previous	year.

	My father is a huge Tiger fan, and I am a loyal Blue Jay fan, who endured the collapse of 87, the heartbreak of 85.  		I don't have the stat book, so let's throw them out.		First of all, Morris in his heyday (81-88) vs Clemens (86-present).		How many Cy Youngs does Morris have?		How many Cy youngs does Clemens have?		Ballparks and such... Fenway average pitchers park.  Detroit, hugh hitters	paradise.   		Morris is a great team pitcher, sort of in the Doug Drabek mold.  	If Morris's team needs a well pitched game, as in Minn in 91, Morris	snaps the ball, and throw for Ks.  Otherwise, he just tries to get people out.		As for Clemens, in the Elias Stat Book of 1992, I believe	that Clemens has the best lifetime record for his team, as compared to	when he doesn't pitch.  How bad would the Red sox have been last year	without him?  Can you say 92 Phillies?		I believe Clemens is the better pitcher because of more power, and hsi	great tenacity.  Morris is among the guttiest pitchers I;ve ever seen,	but Clemens is in a class with Seaver, Carlton, etc.  		Paul sparks

How could you possibly know what team he would be on if Manny Lee was	on his team last year.  After all, Manny Lee wasn't on his team last year,	so it's complete, unfounded speculation to state that if he was on the	same team as Manny Lee last year, it would have been the team of the	Toronto Blue Jays.  Since he and Lee weren't on the same team, you	cannot possibly objectively state what team they would have been on	if they had both been on the same team.		Greg

An	outfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a	lot of balls, preventing both singles and doubles, and also cut off more	uncatchable balls, turinging doubles into singles.  However, a fielder	who plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies; this	means that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles.		Has anyone seen these players' positioning?  Do Butler and Felix play	deep, and Lankford, Martinez, and Wilson shallow, or is this a park	effect?

Year   G   AB     BA   OBP   SLG   HR   SB  CS	1987   21   83  .265  .271  .386    2    4   2	1988  146  563  .259  .317  .439   19   19  10  <-- 3rd Base Expt. year	1989   75  260  .177  .237  .335    9    9   6	1990  152  575  .303  .357  .539   32   33  16	1991  154  561  .251  .338  .496   32   34  15	1992  153  544  .259  .321  .415   17   32  10		In the majors for parts of 6 seasons, total playing time	approx 4.5 seasons.		Just looking at his hitting record, he's had 2 seasons of OPS	greater than .800, which is pretty good for an OF.  His	1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to	third base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF,	he began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.		But no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye	over the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio.  As to his fielding,	he was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came	up through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through	2 position changes in the space of a year.  He's an adequate OF,	although not great, and at least some of your perception of his	fielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the	ML level.  (I know you're another long-term Braves fan :)		About playing 3B...IMO, that's the 2nd most DIFFICULT position	to field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and 	speed, but at 3B, you've got to have quick reflexes and have 	a GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even when	playing sandlot softball!  Granted, I'd still put my best	overall infielder at SS, but that's because he gets more	chances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes me	that so many teams have tried to convert other position players	to 3B.  But maybe that's because the supply of "natural" 3B is	scarce.		Finally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to	perform well, and works hard to improve.  You don't get	those amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a	lot of weight work.  Now, whether he's been overdoing it these	days may be a valid question, as is the question of whether	he tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat.	But frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,	I'd much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not	trying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxation	to an adult; but at that age I don't believe you can teach	hustle.		All that said, I don't think I'd sign Gant to another long-term	contract.  He's 28 now, and I think he's free-agent eligible	in 2 years, when he'll be 30.  Given his career curve and	limitations, I wouldn't expect him to last much past 35	as a ML ballplayer.  He might surprise me here, but Atlanta's	got some talent on the farm, and I'd rather take my chances	down the road with Nieves et al.		Eric

Yes, the	April 12 USA Today lists Le Grand Chapeau as having a .422 batting average	and a .413 OBP. That's on 19-for-45 hitting with 0 (zip, nil, nada) walks.	The reason a lot of us are down on Galarraga is that he's has a long history	of showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability (except for	drawing walks). If he hit .400 for, say, even 250 AB's I'd be convinced that	there was a real change in his ability. If he did it with an OBP<AVG, I'd	not only be amazed but I'd make a bet that that would be a unique feat in	the history of the game. But what do 45 AB's prove? Look at some of the	other fluke players at this point in the season:	  Player    AVG AB	  Blauser  .367 49	  Grace    .391 48	  Milligan .400 35	  Conine   .375 40	  Lansing  .400 50	  Slaught  .406 32	Are any of these guys really that good? Well, in a word, no. How significant	is Galarraga's average? At the 45 AB level, a hit is worth about .020. If	he'd had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good	defensive play, he'd be in the .380 range. If he goes 0-for-4 in his next	game he's all the way down to .388. In one game. Come back in June.

Sheesh.		It's history, Greg. Andres' history is that he doesn't walk much because he	swings at bad pitches, so his average isn't very good. 45 AB's doesn't mean	an awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand, especially when	there's ample evidence (0 BB in 1992) that his basic hitting approach hasn't	changed. Yeah, he might suddenly have turned into a .400 hitter who never	walks, but don't bet the rent money on it.

A 	player's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year.	A player's ability to walk or infielder's Defensive Average are correlated	better.  That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics	we can have a pretty good handle on how they'll do next year.  Put in 	some simple information about aging and you can do even better.  One of 	the basic problems with something like "clutch" batting average - overall	batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. 	Adding to the sample size doesn't seem to help much.  As a counterexample to 	what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:		               Non-Clutch                      Clutch	               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA	 	Maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307	Lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223		If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those "clutch"	situations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in 	1988, Maldonado hit .267 in "non-clutch" and .190 in "clutch", while Lemon	hit .254 in "non-clutch" and .313 in "clutch".  Before you accuse me of 	completely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ "clutch"	at bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simple	measure of clutchness, let's just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use 	'84-'87 to predict '88 for those 96 players, you'd find that 27 of the	96 were below league average in that measure both in '84-87 and in '88,	26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were 	above in one and below in the other.  If you were just flipping coins,	you'd expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  The	difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment	is not statisically significant.		BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with	'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at	something better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their	(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of 	0.088, significant at no level of any interest.		>	>	>>       Everyone would agree (I hope) that a grand 	>>	slam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three	>>	is a VERY clutch hit.

There is a fine line between "getting players' input" and "knuckling	under to players' demands."  A manager, much like a military officer,	needs to have his (her) players' complete obedience and respect during	a game.  After the game, it's no big deal, but when there is no time 	to do more than react, players must trust the manager or the team often	falls apart (see: Boston Red Sox, ff. :) )  		Strawberry's demeanor as represented by the media, often sounds like	demands.  I suspect that a comment like "I enjoy hitting fourth; I'm	used to it" would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if	it came from Strawberry.  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying,	"I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best	in that role."  (Paraphrased by my memory and bias.)  That seems like	a fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question 	like, "How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?"	A more media-sensitive player might answer "The manager knows what he is	doing.  If he thinks that batting me third will help the team, then I	am all for it."  We'd ignore that answer as brown stuff, so it seems a	little bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl's response as petulant.		Personally, I think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn't	matter much in which order the #2-5 players in the order are batted,	except for personal stats.  If I were Darryl, I'd probably answer that	question, "The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get	paid for RBIs.  I think it is best for me to bat fourth, but I am willing	to hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team."  or something like	that.  It would be helpful at salary time--my RBIs were down because I was	hitting third--and make him sound like a "team" player.  Since Strawberry	will not likely go through arbitration, but use the free agent market for	his next contract, maybe that argument is useless, but it would help   	his image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free.		Remember, the media is of the belief that one's best RBI man should hit	fourth, so the argument is sensible, regardless of whether or not it is	true.						--Jeff

There's a blurb in the STATS Scoreboard about this, and though I don't have	the book with me here, my memory is that the best at hitting sac flies were	far below this 60% number.

This sense creates	drama, even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer's	attention.  In baseball, only 3 players are involved in the action for about	(here comes a wild guess) 70% of the time?  And they're just playing a	sophisticated game of catch/hold-the-ball/step-out-of-the-box/adjust-chains/	touch-self-in-interesting-locations.  There's a lot of "dead time" with the	players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the	mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher	who then takes (8? 10?) pitches or Helen Dell playing the organ (Dodger fans	will appreciate that one).  To the non baseball junkie this is boring.	At any rate, I'm not putting baseball down for this - I've been an avid	fan since I can remember - it's just that watching a baseball game on	T.V. at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie.  That's what Major	League Baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of	shortening the game.  It's because of T.V. not because "football has more	action than baseball".			=========================================================================	Steve Conroy			|	conroy@terminus.saic.com	|  "I'm gone, man - solid gone! 					|	Science Applications		|		-Baloo	International Corporation	|	=========================================================================

It's REAL easy to get so focussed on 	minutinae and forget that the Giants happen to be in first place. If it's	working, you don't SCREW IT UP by changing things, just because you think it	ought to be different.		Some folks like to argue about theoretical details. I prefer to watch teams	win. When the Giants slip to third, then we can talk about how to re-arrange	the batting order. Until then, I think it's stupid to focus on what's wrong,	for the simple fact that IT'S WORKING AS IT IS.		>P.S.  Does the mailing list maintainer think that Will Clark is the best 	>first baseman in the majors and that Matt Williams is a better power hitter	>than any other ballplayer?		In the majors? I don't follow AL, so I won't comment on "Majors". In the NL,	if I had my choice of any 1B in the league for my team, it'd be Clark, and	I'd hit him third. (My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it, because	I've never been able to GET Clark. I'd take any of the three without	hesitation in real life, but I think Clark is it).		headcasing it, Matt has a good, solid swing and some real punch. If he drops	to .230, then he wanders out of cleanup, but according to the latest	Baseball Weekly, he's hitting .275, and in the last week, hitting .296.	That's not exactly chopped liver.		Mostly, though, the Giants are winning, and frankly, as long as that	continues, it's rather silly to second-guess their strategy. But evidently,	some folks would rather be right than be first.			-- 	 Chuq "IMHO" Von Rospach, ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com	   Member, SFWA =+= Editor, OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ 	  Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9)	  San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)

A summary of the findings:		Over the 5 year period, sac-fly type fly balls were produced 17.6	percent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful, and 	17.7 percent of the time when a sac fly wasn't useful.		They looked at the leaders in sac flies, and found that the leaders	in sac flies - in other words, the guys you would expect to be good	at it it - hit sac fly type fly balls only 3% more often when they	needed to - a difference way too small to be the result of a skill.	Essentially, the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do	so because they hit hit sac fly type flies often, with and without	a runner on third.		STATS concludes "So it appears conclusive that hitters cannot hit	sacrifice flies on purpose - even if they practice in the bATTING	cage."		gREG

		TWINS UPDATE --  Posted April 22, 1993  	---------------------------------------------	The Twins defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 5-4 today to conclude a three game	homestand with the Brew crew.  The Twins took two of three games in the series,	with scores as follows:		                  Tuesday April 20th    MN  10	                                        Mil  0	                   Winning Pitcher Banks (2-0)  		                  Wednesday April 21st  Mil 10  (10)	                                        MN   8	                    LP  - Hartley ( 0-1 )		                  Thursday April 22nd   MN  5	                                        Mil 4	                    WP - Deshaies (4-0)	                    Sa - Aguilera		Highlight/Low Lights of the Series:	------------------------------------	Jim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins, but of	the American League as well.  Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0	with a 1.74 ERA.  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning	his ERA will climb slightly.  Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade with	Philadelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhail	look like a true genius.		Willie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 innings	on Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting.  Deshaies and Banks now 	combine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are	0-5.		Wednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the	Twins this year (Rickey Bones).  The Twins teed off against both him and 	subsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead	to 7-3.  The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing	4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.	Tapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and Mike	Hartley one walk before the inning was over.  This tied the game at 7-7, and	the Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win	it.		Aguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew.  6 of 20 career blown	saves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well.	Coming into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn,	then hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the	side.  Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie.	Weak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth.		General News	-------------------------------------	Pedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on	Tuesday's game.  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching,	though, which has limited his playing time.  Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former	Gopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.		The Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow.  Starting	Pitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks.  The Detroit	Tigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide 	quite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff.		The Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield,	the third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.		Brian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second	this year, and shows much improvement in this category.		Jim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.  Some say he 	has the best 1st base move in baseball.  This move has enabled him to pitch	out of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 	start.  Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly	in response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the	rubber on the pick-off move.

I don't remember if Seaver managed to get a win against the White Sox	in his brief sojourn with Boston so I'd say the other pitcher to defeat every	team is either Mike Torrez (he bounced around enough for a long enough period	of time) or Koosman as mentioned.

One of the biggest heros to the Latin American audience has been Francisco Cabrerra (a fact of which he was slightly embarrassed!).  		One funny story is that during Spring Training, the Braves played a game in Mexico.  This game was broadcast back to Atlanta in Spanish.

From the raw stats, there is no way to tell which of	a first baseman's putouts were made on throws from other fielders, and	which were made on his own plays; likewise, you can't tell whether a	double play was 6-4-3 or 3-6-3.  Fielding Runs thus gives a first	baseman no credit for putouts or double plays, only for assists and	errors.  		It thus favors first basemen who play deep, reaching a lot of balls but	forcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently.  It also hurts first	baseman who play behind left-handed pitching staffs and thus face few	left-handed batters.		> A better method, but newer and based ondata that has only been collected	> over the last few years, measures the percentage of balls hit into the	> part of the field the guy is responsible for.

This is certainly not the case.  There is no significant *ability* toi	perform in the clutch, but clutch performance certainly happens every	time there is a game-winning hit.  The "clutch pitching" quoted above is	something which happened, not a claim that any particular player should	be expected to be a clutch pitcher.		> Over the past four seasons Sabo has had 59 hits in 259 abs defined as	> clutch situations (by The Scouting Report) for an average of .228.	> Over that same period he had another 1539 abs with 452 hits for an	> average of .294.		> According to the rest of the SDCN's, any differential such as this is	> completely and totally random and cannot be used for any reasonable	> inference, such as perhaps Perez should have used a pinch hitter in	> that situation.		Simple statistics tell me that there is a 2% chance an average clutch	hitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points,	standard deviation about 30).  There will be such hitters in any league,	just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays.		And there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between	clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year,	probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather	than any ability.  *Based only on this data*, I don't see any reason to	pinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch	hitter in the past.		But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit.	Does the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage?  (Any portion of	Sabo's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a	real ability, even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.)  Do you	have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run?  Do you	have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves?		--	David Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu	"We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary."

The main reason is that	good hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull)	are rarely regular DH's, even if they can't field; it's more commonly a	place to put aging veterans.		Another use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury	slowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the	field.  I would expect such players to hit worse as DH's than they did	during the rest of the season.		A third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first	or the outfield don't hit as well as DH's for some reason.  Reggie	Jackson was a good example; in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels, he	hit like the old Reggie when he was in right.		The second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by	their primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60	at DH will count only in the right fielders' averages.		> 	A logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement	> value (if you can find it) for 1B or LF or something.

Although the	*average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left	fielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly	lower; if you are a left fielder but can't hit well enough to keep a job	anywhere, then you certainly can't hit well enough to keep a job at DH.			--	David Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu	"We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary."

I made two statements in my post.		1.	I am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting.		2.	I would have hit for Sabo.			As for #2, many of us make a number of written statements through 	this media about what we think will happen in baseball.  I'm not	shy about it.  I'll make the statement again.  I believe that by	season's end that Chris Sabo's batting average in clutch situations	will be significantly lower than his batting average in non-clutch	situations.  I can't prove that it will happen, so I guess we'll 	just have to wait and see.			- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - -	Here's another one for you.  In 1989 - 1991 Joe Carter's batting	average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting	average in non-clutch situations each year.  I presume you think	this is random.  		Non-Clutch:	1585 AB		411 H		.259	Clutch:		 338 AB		 68 H		.201		So what could we expect in 1992 from Mr. Carter?		Well, his composite BA through 1989 was .268;  through 1990 was	.262;  through 1991 was .263, so I think we have a pretty good	idea of what kind of batting average he can produce.  In 1992	he hit .264.  Not surprising, huh?  Also in 1992: 		Non-Clutch:	 536 AB		144 H		.269	Clutch:		  86 AB		 20 H		.233		No, this doesn't prove any overall statistical trend that can	be used to predict future performance across the breadth of 	major league ballplayers.  It just makes me think that in 1993	Joe Carter's batting average in the clutch is not going to be	as high as his ba in non-clutch situations.	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -	 	As for #1 (above), I have plenty of company.  John Dewan of STATS,INC. is	the editor of The Scouting Report wherein the statistics regarding	clutch hitting are compiled, reported and referenced in the text.	Bill James makes numerous references to a player's ability to hit	well in the clutch.  I am not saying that I can predict the future	any more than they are.   You (and others) are saying that your	work renders their statements (and mine) meaningless.  I don't 	accept that, which in your words proves that I am a "total idiot".			"Stupid".  "Total idiot".

	Like Clinton and Reno, I accept full responsibility for this	senseless disaster.  My wife and I picked this game to go to	and thus caused the return of the pre-season-projected Sox	offense.  Like all no-no's Bosio was good, lucky (hard grounder	by Vaughn off T. Martinez' glove but straight to Boone who 	threw to Bosio at first, 3-4-1), and backed by good defense	(many non-trivial groundouts).  The game was amazingly fast,	as the Sox tended to go down quickly and Hesketh was also 	working fast.  The Sox relief pitching was ok -- the runs off	Quantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single	which Greenwell let get past him trying for a catch.		Greenwell's mental stability is a serious concern (I guess it	has always been, but his quirks were amusing back when he was	an MVP candidate).  Wednesday he got in a huff with Johnson a	after striking out on a bad inside pitch (apparently Johnson	made an "ok, I've got to stay focused" gesture which Iron Mike	interpreted as taunting), and struck out to heavy booing the 	next two times.  As Valentine noted, last night he came up in	the first after Riles and Quintana had walked to open the game.	Can you say "take the first pitch"?  Not Mike, who dribbled it	into a 6-4-3.  The PI quoted Bosio that this was a "batting	practice fastball".  Next time up he also hit the first pitch,	a hard liner straight to KGJr in center.  He also made the	pathetic error and failed to catch Boone's HR (which looked 	comparable to the ball Lance Johnson caught on the highlight	reel that night).		Is Riles suppsoed to be good defensively?  I couldn't tell from	the field angle but his range looked bad, and he coughed a DP	that cost a run or two.  Why was he leadoff?  I hope Fletcher	gets well soon.		Also on lineups, Pinella put Bret Boone fifth for reasons beyond	me.  It seemed to work, as he was 3-4 with a HR and some good	defense (a wag behind us said "He sure don't want to go back to	Calgary!")  There is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth	because they'll likely lead off the second (as Boone did).		Well, now we face the hot Angels and another power pitcher in	Langston.  A reminder that contest entries are open through next	Wednesday -- I expect a surge of pessimism.  By the way, ties will	be broken by earliest entry.  One entry per person or pseudonym,	please, and easy on the pseudonyms.		Dave MB

	I watched the final inning of Bosio's no-hitter with several people at	work. After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the	middle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he	wouldn't have had time to throw Riles out. Yet, the throw beat Riles	by about two steps. I wonder how many others who watched the final out	think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand.	Does anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? And	if he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an	error or a hit? (Judging from Bosio's grimace when the ball bounced	past him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) Whether	Vizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play.				--	--------------------------	Phil Brown                |	aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |	--------------------------

		Oh, yea, and Chris Bosio pitched a NO-HITTER.  One over the minimum, two	bases on ball in the first inning, one runner left, 95 pitches.  I listened	to the game on radio and listening to Dave Niehaus call the game was a	real treat (as long as they keep Ron Fairly quite, I doubt if anyone is	better than Niehaus -- but that Fairly guy is really annoying me).		But, I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching, it would have 	been a different story :-)		Two shutouts in two nights against the hottest, best hitting team in	Major League baseball ....  Pretty impressive in any league.		Man, if Johnson, Bosio and Hanson keep going the Mariners could be a 	really interesting team to follow this year.  Also, John Cummings (rookie)	has had three solid outings with no support.  If Fleming comes back 	this may be the best starting staff in the American League this year	(relief is another story, though - grimace).		Too cool.  The first no-hitter that I have been able to follow from 	start to end.  And again, I think Niehaus will win some kind of award	for the way he called the game.

Actually, I think the large-scale sample size is part of the problem.	It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball	in regard to BA vs. Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of	bell curve.  (The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting	vs. non-clutch;  the Y-axis being the number of players.)  Certainly	there would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell.  My	*supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently	(year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might	be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players	(as opposed to all baseball players).		  As a counterexample to 	>what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:	>	>               Non-Clutch                      Clutch	>               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA	> 	>Maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307	>Lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223	>	>If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those "clutch"	>situations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.

Before you accuse me of 	>completely cooking the data,		You won't hear those kind of accusations from me.  It is interesting	that you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also 	looked at.  He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA),	hitting in 1989 - 92  .217, .273, .250, .272    Admittedly, he has	been traded between leagues as well as clubs.  His clutch hitting 	record is equally inconsistent.  So, for my purposes in 1993 I would	not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based	on his prior performance.  I don't know how I would have felt in 1988,	but you may indeed be right.  		When I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and	a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately	below his non-clutch BA.  Ditto for Joe Carter.		This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having	with others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical	history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before	it has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply	statistical analysis to selected components of the data base?			>BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with	>'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at	>something better than the 99.9% confidence level.

Yet you would pinch-hit	Samuel because you predict that Samuel will be a clutch hitter and	Sabo will be a choke hitter.  Right?  I'd call that "predicting the	future".		>If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time, I assume you	>would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch-	>hitting Samuel.

I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been	shown to be consistent in the past.  Overall performance, L/R splits,	even matching hitting/pitching styles.  All of these will give me some	advantage if used properly.		EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL, there would be no advantage gained by	looking at past clutch performance.  And in this case, everything else	pointed to Sabo.		>One more time.  I did *not* claim to be able to predict the future.	>I said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would	>have had a better chance for success in that situation than Sabo.		That comes down to the same thing.  When Perez left Sabo in, he	was predicting the future, the next AB.  He was predicting that	Sabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel.		By supporting the swap, you are predicting the opposite.		>And I am not dismissing your work.

I'd say this is insulting.		>I did not say that it is a consistent skill.	>	>	I have said that it is an indicator of performance under a	>	certain set of circumstances.		RIGHT!  This is the beef.

If you know of some where it *is* an	indicator of future performance, please let us in on your secret.		>It is nice, however, to see that you will consider the possibility	>that you actually could have some preconceived biases.		Most certainly.  As I have repeatedly stated, if you can come up with	a study which even *hints* at a consistent clutch ability, I would	love it!  However the straightforward attempts at such a study have	all failed miserably.		>>Yeah.  Hindsight is always 20-20.  Doesn't that make you bright?

(Are you honestly debating that???)	Sure, we know Sabo didn't get a hit.  We have no idea whether Samuel	would have done any better or not.  One AB most certainly doesn't	prove anything!		>I believe that by	>season's end that Chris Sabo's batting average in clutch situations	>will be significantly lower than his batting average in non-clutch	>situations.

Or is this	a prediction for *all* batters who have, over the past few years, hit	(xxx amount?)  worse in the clutch than overall?		If you mean the first, then as you say, we'll just have to wait and	see.  But the second is a much stronger statement.  In fact, it	suggests a rule.  We can then test this rule on past data to see if it	worked for recent years.  I think you will agree that if the rule	didn't work last year or the year before, that it is unlikely to do	any better this year.  Right?		>Here's another one for you.

That "has great hands" means nothing.  It seems to me that	a first-baseman's defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily)	from his ability to field grounders or catch popups.  How many such	chances does he get during a game?  Many fewer than he gets chances	to catch throws from 2B,SS,3B and P (I mean the total of these is	much higher than Grounder/Popup totals).  This implies to me that there	is value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-line	or in the dirt.  "Good Hands" are needed for such plays, and thus have	value.  I don't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences	of these plays, but I'd guess that the values of these abilities are	similar.  It's just like: you don't judge catcher's defense primarily	on how they field bunts and popups. (But not as marked I suppose).		Michael

	To all the Braves doubters:		Don't worry.  The bats will come alive, and the Braves will come around.	The pitching is solid, and as long the Braves don't have serious injuries	to the starting rotation, they'll continue to pitch well.  Heck, with	the five starters on the Braves rotation, they could even sustain an	injury to one of the five (I hope this doesn't happen, though).		The bats are there... Pendleton will certainly bat over .280, Justice	is catching fire, Bream, Nixon, Sanders, Gant... well, there's too	much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer.  Right now, the	Cleveland Indians have 7 players batting over .300!  But I certainly	wouldn't their seven for our respective seven (though wouldn't the	Braves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players batting	over .300?).		The bullpen... well, it IS suspect.  But when the bats come alive, the	guys in the bullpen will be of less concern.		So anyway, I believe the Braves will be tough to beat this season.  I'm	not saying the Braves have automatically won the division, but I'm optim-	istic about their season (though it's awful painful to watch them at	times right now).		Go Braves!!!		Dean.

This may be the root of the confusion...		Please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind.  Note	that I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the	question at hand.		Suppose we have a simplified Lotto game.  You pick a number from 1-10	and win if that number is drawn.  Suppose we have a large population	of people who play this game every week.		In the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population	will win 7 or more times.		In the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again	be 7-time winners.		In the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in	each of the first two years will win 7 again.		Suppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After three	years, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last	three years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.		Do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game?	No.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these	"consistent winners" can influence their chances of winning.  But	suppose we *don't* know whether or not there is a chance that skill	might be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are	psychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?		We can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the	population will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a	high positive correlation (even if they aren't very good psychics,	they should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net	result?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.		>This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having	>with others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical	>history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before	>it has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply	>statistical analysis to selected components of the data base?		Well, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has	hit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at	the past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse	as they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn't	seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be	clutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*	streak to be different from past streaks?		Now if it were true that "75% of all three-year streaks remained true	to form", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn't	have zero correlation.  Instead we have "50% of all three-year streaks	remain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse".  You	look at those numbers and say "three year choke streak implies more	likely to choke this year".  But it would be equally valid to look at	those numbers and say "three year choke streak implies more likely to	be clutch this year", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each	way.		>I completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find	>the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent	>basis? 		Then we would have something useful.  And we would also have a	positive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a	pattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern	and then reverses.		Cheers,	-Valentine	
	but as an independent sort of thread.  I do actually quote some things	that Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as	"sampling" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what	I want to say.		maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca (Roger Maynard) writes:	>But the point is that the only decision making pro-	>cess  used to determine the "best" is the score of the game and it re-	>lates to the *teams*.

There's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball	team and some people's conception of a biological organism.  In the	biology context, we would very likely read "fitness" for "the score of	the game" and "organisms" for "teams".  How we interpret "players" is	trickier, but either "organs", or "genes" might seem reasonable	choices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A "genes"	interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, 	but that would be a different and probably longer post.		If, however, we take the "organ" view, then our knowledge of biology	should make us pause before we start saying things like "species X is	more fit than species Y because of a better organ Z".  Given what we	know about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious	of such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often	made when you map "species X" onto 'humans', and "organ Z" onto	'brain').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem	more reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. 'brain'	above might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no gross	pathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).		Even when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the	functioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ	might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.	(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial	in some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any	kind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is	not some completely magical unanalyzable "whole" but an intriguing	process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are	potentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to	particular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple	organs.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I	think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved	in baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.		>To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-	>solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B	>in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.		One thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly	controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, of	course, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they	can, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the	absence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,	but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.		>If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens	>has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a	>criteria, then fine.		In this cases, we're seeing the word "statistics" means "summary of	observed events", where the events themselves can be viewed as the	output of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.	Thus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together	into the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might	give us a basis to test particular hypotheses.		>But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the	>individual's contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only	>measure of "best" that has any meaning in the context of baseball.		This statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.	Fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;	you might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to	baseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an	environment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least	a nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the	league, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any	of their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly	large random component in the performance of each team that is	difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors	intrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in	biology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the	World Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component	may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,	and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement	where they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but	it's unclear what it all really means.		***		Now just one more un-related point:		>I have yet to see that any of you can predict a	>WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.		On the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the	outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of	teams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this	better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.	But this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule	gives you a little hope that bad hops aren't the only difference	between the winners and the losers.		Moreover, you've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World	Series situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict	the WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only	to reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.		>The stats are a nice hobby and that's about it.  There is no new	>knowledge being produced.  		Since stats are summaries of events, it's true that if you know the	events you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to	understand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new	knowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and	useful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge	in a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge	even though I'm relying on stats to do it.		jking

No platoon advantage (Sabo vs. Samuel).		Both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters,		and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with		slow curves and change ups.		Sabo has more power, and a little bit of a better batting eye.  Samuel		is noted as an agressive free-swinger.  Sabo has more homerun power.		Both players started the game hitting below .200.  		There may have been some game considerations that might have prompted		Perez to want to reserve Samuel for use later.  But the game		*was* on the line, and Samuel never did get in.		Given all of this, I don't see a lot to suggest pinch-hitting, nor do	I see anything to suggest no pinch-hitting.  There is, of course, the	clutch-hitting information.  But if that's useless...

Let's be careful here.  If players' performance was completely random	in (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be	good in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year.	With two years worth of data, you'd have 1/4 of the players good each	year, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year.	We have 96 players for 5 years ('84-'88).  Just flipping a coin, you'd	expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year.	This is what we actually get--		No. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5	Clutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3	Coin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3		Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years	of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process	leading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random.	If there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition)	that had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of	players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping	a coin.  Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above	or below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from 	the mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.	In the four years ('84-'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there	were 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch 	situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of	those 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two	years.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and	really horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process, 	you'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).  		Everything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period	of years that could be used to predict any ability with any 	proposed definition has looked like a random process (with the 	caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage	that could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein 	probably never had a "clutch" AB against a left-handed pitcher,	but he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would	be a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his 	platoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glanced	at casually.  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into 	studying it and every one of them, with the exception of the	Elias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow	you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better	than flipping a coin.  (Self-serving plug follows:  some of the	flaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth-	coming SABR book, _The Perfect Game_, by Taylor Publishing.  The	authors are supposed to get a slice of the advance, so go bug	your local bookstores now, and maybe I can get enough to take my	wife to dinner once.:-)		Harold	-- 	Harold Brooks                    hbrooks@uiatma.atmos.uiuc.edu	National Severe Storms Laboratory (Norman, OK)	"I used to work for a brewery, too, but I didn't drink on the job."	-P.

My understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot 	pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least 	appear in the on-deck circle.  Also, the lead a pitcher enters with cannot 	excede three runs.		I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in 	determining winners/savers/etc.  For instance, a pitcher can come in in the 	ninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in 	the next half inning and earn the win.  Has this pitcher earned a win, no 	way.		I guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his 	teammates rally to tie the score.  Assume he came in to start the fourth 	and left after the eighth.  His teammate holds the opposition scoreless in 	the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win.  The 	third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no "stat" 	satisfaction.		Mike		I bleed the blue of Dodgers and even like Lasorda spaghetti sauce.	>

Henderson is the best leadoff hitter of all-time, arguably. Winfield has  	meant more to his team than Henderson. Unlike daryll, henderson tries  	hard. He is an amazing centerfielder. Rickey is VERY good, maybe better  	than winfield, I was angry at the dissing of winfield. Though Winfield has  	been better than henderson lately. Check the numbers, winfield may  	surprise you. He will have 3000 basehits, and should have 500 homeruns  	when he retires(wishful thiniking if he plays to 45)

	I don't actually have the answer to this one.		Bosio, after walking the first two batters, retired 27-straight for a	"back-end" perfect game.		How many other games - including extra inning games - have seen a pitcher	retire 27 straight, excluding official perfect games?		The only other instance of this I know about for sure is the famous Ernie	Shore game, which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in	Cooperstown. Shore came into the game when Boston Pitcher Babe Ruth got	thrown out for arguing over the first-batter walk; Shore picked him off and	retired 26 straight after that.

	Just to add to this vein, consider that range of a first baseman is not	the only important thing.  He is IMO the best fielder of bad throws from	the other infielders.  I have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt, catch	balls off a large bounce, take down balls over his head, wide, etc. ad	infinitum.  *And* he gets the out, much of the time.  Some of the things	he does to save his infielders of errors are amazing.

Funny how he wins a lot of games when he pitches on good teams but	loses a lot when he pitches on bad ones. And if "rings" was the only	criteria for success, then teams would always tend to repeat, and	eventually you'd have the same team win the WS every bleepin' year. Sort	of like the yanks in the 50s.		Morris is a decent pitcher on the downside of a good, not great, career.	Toronto will finish 3rd or 4th this year, with Morris and all those	rings, because their pitching staff was destroyed over the off-season.		Steve Thornton   stevet@eskimo.com

Minor point:  Shea Stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but	not with the Jets in mind as the tennant.  The New York Football Giants	had moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and was	having problem with stadium management (the City did not own Yankee	Stadium until 1972).  The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea.	When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the	new AFL franchise, the New York Titans, approached the City about using	the new stadium.  The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where the	Cosmos played soccer in the 70s).  Because Shea Stadium was tied into	the World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to	promote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doing	with the Mets).  So the deal was worked out.		>Of course, with the Jets gone to Jersey (and a truly good football	>stadium), the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where,	>because it's circular, the seats are almost always too far from the	>action.

Ken Rogers started for the Rangers and 	gets the loss.  He was relieved by Burns in the 7th.		The Rangers got their only run on a solo home run by Dean Palmer in the 7th.	The Tigers opened the scoring with an RBI single by Fryman in the 3rd, then	took the lead for good in the bottom of the seventh when Whitaker greeted	reliever Burns with an RBI double which scored Tettleton.  Whitaker in turn	crossed the plate on an RBI single by Phillips (who has been red hot) for 	the third Tiger run.		This afternoon, it's another battle of southpaws, Bill Krueger for the Tigers	vs. Craig Lefferts for the Rangers.		--Randy		p.s.  Toronto Blue Jay fans, thanks for Wells and MacDonald!

The stats show he	is a mediocre pitcher at best (this year is another case), he just happened	to win 21 games. I saw many of his games last year, he did pitch some good	games. But this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense, he was 	constantly giving up go ahead runs in the 6-8th innings (the clutch innings)	and the Jays would somehow scrape a win for him. Another major factor in	his 21 wins, is that Cito 'I dont realize i have a bullpen' Gaston would	leave Morris in for ever, therefore giving him many more chances to win	games (i believe this is the major reason he won 21 games last year).

Don Baylor was his batting coach at St. Louis last	year, and now, as his manager, is continuing to work with him.  Maybe Andres	has a "weak" left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at the	ball.  Or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics - I dunno.

I am astounded at	the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only	don't understand but publicly admit to not understanding. In fact, there's a	plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins.		For the record, there are two ways that a reliever can get a save:	He must finish the game and either	1. have entered the game with the tying run on base, at bat, or on deck.	2. have pitched at least three innings effectively.	A pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game.		>I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in 	>determining winners/savers/etc.  For instance, a pitcher can come in in the 	>ninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in 	>the next half inning and earn the win.

For example If it is the bottom of the 8th inning and Clemens is	pithching. The Red Sox are leading 4-1 and Clemens has just givin up a hit. So,	there is a man on first, the batter, and the batter on deck could tie the game	with a homer.  If Jeff Russel came in, (The Red Sox reliever), and finished the	game without allowing the tieing or losing run to score, he would get the save	and Clemens would get the win.

So I'll take this opportunity to note that the red feet are now 11-5 and	slinking out of town without having scored a run in the last two games	or even a hit in last night's gem.

That is *your* opinion that Sabo is "clearly a better hitter" than	Samuel.  The above data is for a 4-year period ending last season.	Last season Samuel batted .272 while Sabo hit .244 (not park adjusted).	This season they are both hitting below .200, albeit Sabo with more	at bats.  I will agree that over his career Sabo has been a better	hitter than Samuel, but I will also remind you that Samuel has been	a better hitter in certain situations than Sabo.		I did not predict that Sabo would choke, nor that Samuel would get a	hit.  I expressed my opinion that had I been the Reds manager (or	even a Reds fan) that I would prefer to have Samuel hit in that	situation than Sabo.			>>If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time, I assume you	>>would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch-	>>hitting Samuel.

That is, I haven't yet found someone who hit significantly below	his overall batting average in clutch situations for the years 	1989 - 91, and then reversed that relationship in 1992.			>Gambler's fallacy.

But if you were interested in a reason why I expect	Chris Sabo's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one	year to the next, I think I could.  If you were interested in a	reason why I expect Joe Carter's ability to hit in the clutch to	correlate from one year to the next, I think I could.  But you're	not interested in that, because you think that those conclusions	could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire	baseball population.

I accept your work.	I believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based	on prior clutch history is meaningless.  No better than a coin toss.	I actually *do* accept your work.		As it happens, I also have an *opinion* that in certain situations,	for certain players, a history of superior or inferior ability to	hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be	valid in projecting future player performance.  For that player.	And Chris Sabo is one such player.			>So tell me?  Does the term fit?  Or do you have an open mind?		Well, since I defer to your statistical wisdom, I think I must have	an open mind.  Now we have to pose the same question to you.					--	The Beastmaster				-- 	Mark Singer    	mss@netcom.com

[detailed explanation deleted..]			Indeed, you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement. To 	rebut my opinion, you have made an analogy with a game of chance.	Your hypothesis assumes that the Lotto players have no impact on	the selection of the numbers, and hence their ability to win.		Well, that's certainly true in Lotto.  But it has absolutely	NOTHING to do with the sport of baseball.  When you start down	the wrong path, you finish down the wrong path.						I repeat.  I do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch	hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting	performance.		I do, however, think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance	may, for some players, indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed	will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance.	And I think Chris Sabo is such a player.					--	The Beastmaster		-- 	Mark Singer    	mss@netcom.com

Uh, that poster specifically stated "allow me to be the first". It is NOT a	quibble, then, to state that "the media" did not portray Canseco as being 	lazy. If the other person chooses to so accuse him, after my post, that does not	make it a quibble. And in fact, the media around here tend(ed) to play up his	time in the wieght room.

Well, Canseco has been involved in several felonies, including his high-speed	record, carrying concealed fire-arms, and of course the domestic violence. 	Clemens had a run-in at a bar.

No way -- gotta be Walter Johnson.  All were with Washington.	Carlton spent too long in St. Louis to collect less than 700 there.		>With the Rangers, Hough was there for a long time.

And to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game,	all I can say is that you'd be making baseball history.  Even in	the worst baseball brawls, usually only the major instigators are	ejected, not everyone who comes onto the field.  And I'd have to 	say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game	 than what the Braves did Fri. night.		Anyhow, that's my last two cents on the subject, barring	outrageous postings.  I will try to keep my eyes open	for more incidents involving Hirschbeck. I think there will	be some with other teams as well.  I hope not.		Eric

I saw that quote flashed on the screen yesterday also, and what enraged	me more than anything was not that George was speaking up agai and complaining	to the media instead of to the proper people, it was that the idiot reporter	provided George with an outlet and an opportunity to create trouble.  This is a	supreme example of how the media can truly control situations.  The local beat	reporters should know better and should stop trying to one-up each other with	quotes from the Boss.

Well, there were 27 outs in a row with no hits or walks in between, but	really, he only retired 26 batters in a row.  The first out of the game	was the front end of a double play.

Granted, he hasn't been a full time player but	when he does play I've always thought he had a good bat.	He might be demoralized about not playing full time, but	he hasn't been shuttled around.  I think he's been in New York	ever since he had 34 hits in 100 AB back in 1989, or 90, I	believe.  	I don't think he is gold glove calibre, but he doesn't boot	it around either.

I don't have any stats	to back this up, and I don't know if his Defense would	cost any games, but I think he could help - and he has	this year.  He has 3 HR already.  Same goes for	Jim Leyrtiz.  He has a big mouth, but he does get	the job done when he concentrates.  I think the situation	with Leyritz is that he believes he is a potential	super-star, and he gets pissed about not playing.

You're certainly right that the runner is	not out merely for running out of the baseline: he must interfere with	the play.  But the argument here is over what constitutes interference.	You certainly cannot infer from what you've quoted that the batter-runner	must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference: you haven't posted	a definition of interference at all.		IMO this calls for one of the "approved ruling[s]" that go in small print	in the rulebook.  Something like:		APPROVED RULING:	If in the judgement of the umpire the runner, by running to the left	of the allowed path, caused the fielder to make a bad throw, blocks the	vision of the fielder receiving the throw, or otherwise impedes the	defensive team's making a play on him, the batter-runner shall be	judeged guilty of interference.		or		APPROVED RULING:	The runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes	contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball.		--	In the absence of such an approved ruling I claim that this is a poor	rules trivia question--since it cannot be authoritatively answered.	-- 	Len Reed	Holos Software, Inc.

Just because someone consistently pulls the ball does not mean that	they have a quick bat.  Dawson's release is slow, and he *IS* 38, after	all.  He may swing early, and rotate his hips so that he hits the ball to 	the left side all the time, but he swings slowly.		As for me disagreeing with Peter Gammons... Whoa!

			Hi there,		      I was wondering if anyone knew if John Wetteland was put on the DL again	      after his first 15-day period was up? I read in the USA Today Sports 	      section that he is on for "surgery to repair broken toe", and was	      wondering if that was new. I thought he was just letting it heal. 		      Another question, Is Derek Lilliquist the main closer for the Indians now	      that Olin is gone. I need to know cause I need to find a reliever to 	      replace Wetteland and so far Lilliquist is doing ok. Any information on	      either of the players would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your	      time. 			      Ryan Robin.		___________________________________________________________ 	  	  [==================]         Texas Rangers in 1993!

I was at that game, behind home plate next to a scout who was manning the 	radar gun.  The 1991 season was winding down and Roger didn't have his 	best fastball, topping out at 88-90 (in contrast to Frank Tanana, who went 	as low as 50 with one lollipop in the process of striking out Phil 	Plantier *five* times on the night).

Matt's problem is really more ability than attitude.  It isn't that he's	got it in his mind that he wants to swing away, but rather that he's	(still) a total sucker for the curve ball.  It looked for a while in	1990 that he was getting better but it's still his weak point.

Ms. Nichols has given the average game times (and average runs scored) for	1983 and 1992.  (A very nice piece of information, Ms. Nichols.  Who knows?	She may be listening, and not have me in her kill file after all.)  Those	numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half-a-run *less* being	scored per game, and the games taking 15 minutes *longer*.  Something is	being done now that wasn't done ten years ago, which is extending the games	by 15 minutes.  Ms. Nichols thinks it's more pitches.  Given the increasing	specialization of pitchers, it wouldn't surprise me.		If it's not simply more pitches, though, I don't think it's unreasonable	to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back.  Then	I get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher	after he comes in, and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules,	which have been stated in other posts in this thread (and other related ones).		The problem is, who decides whether that time is "wasted?"  You don't seem	to think it is at all.  Right now, I think it is, although I have heard one	case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs (the	difference in mounds between the field and pen) -- but who knows?  If the	rules get changed, maybe something I didn't foresee will happen to change my	mind.  But you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing,	or else nothing will be changed.

That's the trouble: *what* peak years?  He wavers between excellent and	very good, with no real bell-shaped pattern in there.  1979 was a fine	year; 78 and 80 were merely really good.  With the Yankees, 84 (I think)	was the best; that was the one with the .340 BA.  		Of course, 1992 wasn't bad, either.  He's been in the bigs since 1973,	with a one-year intermission for surgery.  Though he doesn't have the	mix of skills that Pete Rose did, he's like Pete Rose in one way: he's 	not a natural hitter.  Winfield's swing used to be the ugliest thing	in New York, and that includes the Gulf+Western Building.  But his sheer	athletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot.  		Fascinating player to watch, even now.  Not obviously great in any one	way; but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising	levels.		Roger
