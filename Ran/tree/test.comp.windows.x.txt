		I am *almost* done porting XFree86 1.2 to a new piece of display	hardware, but have run into a snag I think may be somewhat	commonplace, so I'm sending a net-feeler.		I have a display that is a non-interlaced, memory mapped, 1-bit	720x280 display.  The server's view of the world, (obtained via xwd |	xwud), seems to be exactly what it should be.  However, the displayed	version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is	using scanlines that are too long.  After a bit of experimentation, it	seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to	a word boundry, but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes, which	isn't exactly divisible by four.  Changing the following defines in	mit/server/include/servermd.h:		----		#define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  32	#define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		5	#define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2		---		to:		---		#define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  16	#define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		4	#define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2		---		Was not exactly the right solution.  How do I tell the server either	(a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being	built to run on this particular display), or to pad only to byte	boundries?		I'm using a customized version of XFree86v1.2, under Mach 3.0.		Thanks	Brian	
		We've just recently upgraded our X11 to R5 and are now running into problems	with some of our applications that use Motif 1.1.  It appears that pointer to	the widget being passed to the callback function (i.e., the "w" of	(w, client, call) ) is nil.  The client and call pointers are okay in some	instances, but bogus in other instances.		We are running SunOS 4.1.2 on a Sun 4.  After compiling X11R5 and all 23	patches (with the MotifBC flag set), we recompiled Motif and then we 	recompiled the application.		Did we skip a step or leave something out?  Is there a flag that we should	have used?  Should we have left Motif alone?		Any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

	Hi there		(I posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response, so I'm posting	here.)		I'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation (an HP 720).	It is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices	including digitiser tablets.  However, this digitiser makes use of the serial	port, so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver.		The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from	devices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file (* = display number).	I shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input	device in this file and expect a digitiser to work.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Am I?		What I would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected	to their workstation for use as a pointer for X (rather than just as input to a	specific X application)?  If so, what were the steps required for installation?	Did you need a special device driver?  Did the manufacturer supply it?  Are	there generic public domain device drivers around?  (I understand that	digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.)		Any help would be greatly appreciated.

	I've found a problem in the use of Xlib functions regarding re-entrancy. I	decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling	XDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are	waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system).	I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring	the standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core , and upon analysis	it was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString	was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor	was called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating	was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been.		Has anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation that	says you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic.	We are running on SGI Irix 4.0.1 with X11R4.				-- 	Regards, Martin		   /\/\     :  Martin Visser - Electrical / Software Engineer 	  / / /\    :  Engineering Technology Department	 / / /  \   :  BHP Steel - Slab and Plate Products Division	/ / / /\ \  :  P.O.

Judging from the responses so far, I have not made clear enough in my	article quoted above that Imake-TeX is not for installing TeX, but for	*using* it. With Imake-TeX, you will never again have to fiddle around with	calling latex and its various utility programs (makeindex, bibtex). Simply	type "make" and your document's DVI file will be up-to-date. All you have	to do is to write a simple Imakefile and let Imake generate a suitable	Makefile for you. Here is such an Imakefile:			#include "TeX.tmpl"		PaperFormatA4()		SimpleLatexTarget(document)		The generated Makefile provides the following commands:		    make depend:    Searching the TeX source files for dependencies like	                    \input{somefile}		    make dvi:       Generate an up-to-date DVI file		    make viewdvi:   Display it on your screen		    make ps:        Generate a PostScript version of your document		    make viewps:    Display it		    make clean:     Remove unnecessary things		    make veryclean: Remove even the DVI file		    make Makefiles: Generate Makefiles in subdirectories			If ...		a) ...this seems attractive to you,	b) ...you are willing to test Imake-TeX and send me a short test report,	c) ...you are willing to cope with a rudimentary English documentation	   (however, the German version is completed and included),		then you are invited as a beta tester.

		Hi ppl,		I am running XFree386 under Linux SLS1.0 and am trying to get the german	keyboard working. I have already recompiled my kernel and the german	keyboard in the textmode works just fine.	I have found out, that there is a preconfigured german keymap for X	called Xmodmap.gr in /usr/lib/X11, so I ran xmodmap /usr/lib/X11/Xmodmap.gr.	My first impression was very good, I was able to get Z and Y straight :)	There's still a little problem I can't solve however:	I cannot get at the backslash, bar, brackets and curly brackets.	The ALT-GR key doesn't seem to work.	I tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does.	Looking up its keycode (113) in the Xmodmap I found the entry "Mode_switch"	which doesn't ring any bell. The entries for the keys I cannot use seem	to be correct. Example: keycode XX = ssharp questn backslash	The first 2 entries I can even get at. The first one is the unmodified	key and the second is the key with shift, but what is the 3rd??	My guess is that it should be the key with ALT-GR but it isn't.	If anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them,	help would be appreciated.		CU		Alaric

	I have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes	and collects data from that nodes periodically. I need to display this data on	my X Application. I tried	to invoke this server using XtAddAppTimeout which works ok. But the	problem here is some time there is delay in collecting data. So I doesn't	returns to EventLoop during that time and my application remains busy and	It doesn't respond to users input. I button press events are queued and	exected after server finished its task. Now I am going to try AppAddInput	call. So that It reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe.		I am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client	which is my X application will read. Now I have some doubts which you may	be able to clarify.		1) When I fork a process. It will create to copy of my process. Right !!	   Now what does this two copies mean? Two Shells. Where should I fork	   my application. What are the responsibilities of this processes. How	   should I call this processes.?		2) Can I fork more than one processes. So that I can read from more	   than one servers input.

The first sentence describing the bitmap resource in the	MenuButton section of the "Athena Widget Set - C Language Interface"	documentation states		      bitmap      A bitmap to display instead of the label.		One way round this might be to make use of the button's backgroundPixmap	resource, but remember that you, or a user of your application, won't be able	to set it from a resource file. Also, the button won't automatically be the	size of the bitmap. The bitmap will be tiled if necessary, or you could set the	button's dimensions to match its size.

	The MOTIF application consists of multiple Transient shells as children 	of a single TopLevel shell:		+-----------+   +---------------+   +----------------+	| AppShell  |---| TopLevelShell |---| TransientShell |	+-----------+   +---------------+ | +----------------+	                                  |	                                  | +----------------+	                                  |-| TransientShell |	                                  | +----------------+	                                  |		While a Transient shell is popped-up, my application modifies the 	sensitivity of a button in the TopLevel shell which is hidden by the 	Transient shell window.  When the Transient shell is popped-down, the 	button sensitivity is correct but the button text remains unchanged 	(i.e., solid/shaded).  Subsequent selection of the button causes the 	text to revert to the correct visual state.		When tracing event messages sent to the application, many of the events 	seen under mwm are not present under OpenWindows.		If anyone has any suggestions or solutions please post or send me mail.	  Thanks!

Had you bothered to consult the distribution terms of the IJG JPEG	code (which are right there in the xv distribution), you would have	observed that we specifically grant permission for use in shareware	and commercial software.

That is, you have to rig up a timer queue, and you have to put a 	select(2) or poll(2) call in your main loop.

	I'm trying to turn on Xauthorization using MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE on my servers	(CPU heads, HP700RX Xterminals), but I'm running into a couple of problems.		First, at least one of our applications (Maple) doesn't seem to understand 	how to deliver the magic cookie, and won't run on a display with authorization	turned on. 		Second, we have people with client software on remote machines, and I	really don't want to hassle them with having to copy their .Xauthority	file to the remote machine... assuming that the clients there support	Xauthorization.		So, what I would like to do is turn on MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE by default, with	non-privileged users able to turn it off - dropping back to host-based	authorization.		(Yes, I know how to turn it off by changing the Xconfig file for the	heads and the Client Authorize setting for the Xterminals, but	non-privileged users can't do this.)		I've checked with the HP Support Line, and there doesn't appear to be a way.	Can anyone confirm this, or do you know of a way to accomplish what I	want?		BTW, I'm running HPUX 9.0, and Vue 3.0.

	I am having the problem of ensuring point-to-focus when the mouse	cursor enters a window in my application.  I'm using InterViews,	but that may not matter, this seems to be a generic problem in X.	For example, I use OpenWindows on a Sparc2, with point-to-focus	set, and that generally works, but not always, depending on what	was going on in some window when I move the cursor from one shell	tool window to another.  Or so it seems...		My question, then, is what can I do within X to guarantee point-to-	focus within my application?  Thanks for any response.		Dave

		I am looking for a  program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my Linux	system.		- It must be free.	- It must run on standard (monochrome) X with a small screen size (800x600)	  No motif/openlook etc.	- It must compile under Linux with gcc/g++. Most generic unix software	  works ok.	- It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents	  with dvips. Or just tell me another free program that converts one	  of the supported formats to ps.	- It must produce drawings that are larger than the window size (scrollable).		I know of several such programs, idraw, xfig. tgif. I have	no experience with any of them. Features I would like in the programs are.		- ability to draw circles, arcs, straight lines, boxes and arrows.	- support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects.	- support for texts in any size.	- ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing.	- ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component	  (e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines, an arrow and a circle)	- any aid (numeric coordinates, screen grid) to align parts of the drawing.	- less essential, but in fact very handy: preservation of connection.	  If I move one part of the drawing, the lines that connect that part to the	  rest of the drawing, stay connected.		Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to	draw electronic schematics, flow charts, logic diagrams, data flow diagrams	and block diagrams with it. 		I just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my	whishlist and are there any other programs? How demanding are the programs	with respect to disk space, memory and CPU usage? Are any of the programs	known to work on Linux with monochrome X?		Lennart.	
	                          The Andrew Consortium	          of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon 	                         is pleased to announce		                          AUIS 5.1.1 for AIX3.2	                                 4/26/93		The Andrew User Interface System version 5.1 (our CDrom version) was	developed for AIX  version 3.1 on the IBM RS/6000 and many other	platforms.  To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch to	the sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its	application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the	internet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory	./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5" diskette can be	ordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address	below. 		The base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the	same host.		Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows	AUIS to compile under AIX3.2.		-----------		The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment	on top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media	applications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the	capability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text that	not only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but	also  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors,	equations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can	themselves contain other objects, including text.		AUIS has three components:		    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set	    of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help	    system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell	    interface, and other editors corresponding to the various	    available types of objects. 		    The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented	    user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein	    objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,	    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as	    easily as those that come with the system. 		    The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface	    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail	    management strategies and implements many advanced  features	    including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of	    mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails	    of related messages, and subscription management. It also	    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and	    low-function personal computers in addition to high-function	    workstations. 		The current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support for	the new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards	for multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members of	the Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new	editors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences.			Remote Andrew Demo Service		You can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew	Demo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11	window system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate	through the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System	to browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and	newsgroups.		To get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the	following command on your machine:			finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu		The service will give you further instructions.

	REPOST:		I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure	events are handled.		I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the	capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be	resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.	The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event	calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a "fake" Expose	event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)	to draw the data.		Quest 1.	When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)	I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size	is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right?	Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?		Quest 2.	When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events	whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

	One way to "mask" the left button check the contents of the XEvent that the	XAddEventHandler send to your event_handling function (in your case, it is the	show_mouse_position function. 		If the XEvent arrive in this function as 		XEvent p_event;		then, the value of p_event->xbutton.button is the button that was pressed.

	Hello!!!		The title just about says it all.		I need a list of the bugs for Motif 1.2.		Thanks,	Neal		
	I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif, but I'm hoping	is really just a mistake on my part.  Does anyone know anything about	this problem........		- I am using an XmTextField, and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded	  text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString.	  The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed, the text is getting	  truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables	  LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese,	  the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english, everything	  works fine.  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns.	  (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual	   application, just in my sample code to make things easier)			- I am running Motif 1.2, X11R5 via HPUX9.01.  My test program is set up	  to handle 16 bit Kanji characters.  I have remembered to do   	  XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources	  are set to japanese fonts.		- Don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and TextField is initially	  created with UIL. 			The problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substituting	XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable	alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!)		I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone	wants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not	properly allocating memory for japanese, but since I don't have the	source to look at it is just a guess.		Please let me know if this sounds familiar, or if you have a suggestion,	or if you want the sample program.		THANKS!!!!!!!!		- Susan 		  swalker@bbn.com	  617-873-8190

This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents	windows, a misfeature of the X protocol, and a bug in the Xt intrinsics.  		The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (x,y) position given in	ReparentNotify events.  Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a window	is popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. 	At this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date.		If a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks it	needs to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it	there.  However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow	request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The	Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out after	wmTimeout has expired.  (Actually, things are somewhat more complex because	the request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is the	same.)		The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning information	in ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5	public fix 20.  This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in	gorier details.		s'marks		-- 	Stuart W.

	I don't seem to be able to get window positions reliably through	the XView xv_get() function:		   x = (int) xv_get(my_frame, XV_X);	   y = (int) xv_get(my_frame, XV_Y);		For example, if I set XV_X & XV_Y to 50,50 the frame comes up	in the correct position, with the top left corner (the size	handle) at 50,50. xv_get() returns 50,50 as well. But later on	xv_get() returns 5,25 without any intervening xv_set(my_frame,	XV_?). My frame is fitted around a canvas, and it turns out	(by measuring on the screen) that 5,25 is the position of the	first pixel in my canvas relative to the frame's origin. What	gives? Any help most appreciated!		Derek		P.S. On a related subject, is there any way of querying the	window manager as to the thickness of borders it puts around	frames, etc.?		-----------------------------------------------------------	| Derek C.

	Yesterday I changed the US-Keyboard of my Sparc10 with a german keyboard.	And now I cannot get any "Alt Graph" characters ('tilde' usw.).	When I exit from X I can get the characters, but not under X.		Can anybody give me some hints, where to check for the correct installation	of the keyboard.		Martin Kreutzer		
	Answers please by e-mail, since not all groups in the header are carried here.		Hi!		Personally, I like NeXTSTEP very much. Even more when I realise how much a  	burden ordinary X or Windows programming is. I also like Objective-C better  	than I like C++.		But, sometimes the restrictions are there. For instance it sometimes has to be  	MS-Windows or X. Now I'm looking for pointers to tools on those environments  	that come close to NeXTSTEP, the appkit etc. Also, environs that support rapid  	prototyping (like with IB) without producing spaghetti-code as soon as you want  	to do real work.		Maybe STEPSTONE with some Windows version of a kit of UI objects? Interviews  	(what it is exactly, I don't know. I kind of lost touch with that world when I  	started with NeXTSTEP.)

	At the moment, I am using a Sun 3/80 (cgfour/bwtwo) with SunOS 4.0.3	and OpenWindows 2.0.		This configuration is slow and I can't run all the programs on OW2. For	example, when I start a mailtool from OW3 and display it on my OW2	display, I can't open the compose window.		I want to install an X11R5 or X11R4 server on my Sun and use xdm (yes,	we have xdm already running for other X-Terminals) to log in and start	the X programs.		Is there a "ready to go" binairy of the X11 server for my configuration	(I have read something about Xsun), or must I compile the X11 stuff by	myself?		Any help is welcome			V.

	Hello,			I am admin for an RS/6000 running AIX 3.2, X11R5, Motif, and xdt3.		I want to prevent the user from hitting CNTL-ALT-BKSPC to exit X.				I've tried invoking X with 'xinit -T', but that doesn't work.		xinit appends the -T to the call to .xinitrc, and not to the		call to X.  			The man page to xinit is no help.  In fact, it tells		me that xinit is a script when it is really a binary file.  			So far, the only way I've been able to accomplish this feat is		to add the -T to the call to X in /usr/lpp/X11/defaults/xserverrc.		I would rather not do it this way.  Does anyone have any other ideas?		 	------------------------------------------------------------------------	  Brian DeFord				Internet: deford@netwrx1.nw1.com		  Open Networks, Inc.

Anyway, at SIMULOG, we will abandon xv. We were using it mostly for slide-	shows because of its "-loop" feature that display does not have (display	from the *wonderful* ImageMagick package! :-D), but I think I will implement	it myself (even a shell-script should do the job) and forget xv.

	I am saving an image on one machine and redisplaying the image on	another machine (both are HP 9000 Model 750s).  The image is created	using XCreateImage and XGetImage and displayed with XPutImage.  The	image is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because	the server on the other machine is using a different colormap.		I tried saving the colormap (pixel and rgb values) and on the redisplay,	performed a table lookup against the new colormap.  This didn't work	because some rgb combos don't exist in the new colormap.		Is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values, or	is there a simpler way to solve this problem?  I tried using xinitcolormap	but couldn't get that to work either.		Any help would be appreciated.		--------------------------------------	Don Lemoine	Naval Surface Warfare Center	Dahlgren Division	Dahlgren, VA 22405	(703)663-7917	dlemoin@xobu.nswc.navy.mil

	[[ I posted this a few weeks back, but all I got back was an error	   message "pnews: /dev/null: Permission denied".  Yep, /dev/null	   had a mode of 600.  (Arrghhh!!)  ]]		With renewed interest in "setting the DISPLAY variable", etc.. I	thought I would post my contribution.		This Perl script is my solution.  It trys to be intelligent about	what it's doing so that you should be able to type "rx host.domain.etc",	and get a xterm running on "host.domain.etc", with all the difficult	stuff taken care of.		In theory, this program can do *everything* you ever wanted to do	when you wanted to run a remote command in the background - it	doesn't even need to be an X program.  Try a "rx big-machine make"	for instance, for a backgrounded make on the remote "big-machine".		For more details and a full list of features read the README file,	about 20 lines below...

X]	X.SH DESCRIPTION	XThe 	X.B rx	Xprogram connect to the specified	X.I host	Xand executes the specified	X.I command	Xin the background, returning immediately.  To allow the execution	Xof X programs, it copies a number of environmental variables to	Xthe remote session.  If you omit	X.IR command ,	Xthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host.  The	X.B rxterm	Xvarient starts a remote xterm on a host, and also passes	X.I args	Xto the remote xterm as arguments.	X.PP	XShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local	Xmachine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote	Xmachine.	X.PP	XIf the name of the file from which	X.B rx	Xis executed is anything other than ``rx,''	X.B rx	Xtakes this name, stripped on a leading ``r'' as the command	Xto run on the remote host, using any	X.I command	Xparameters as arguments for the remote command.	X.PP	XIf	X.B rx	Xthinks you are using	X.B xauth	Xbased X authorisation, and you are calling to a off-site host, or	Xto a different username, it will attempt to copy an authorization	Xkey to the remote account.  Otherwise it will try to use	X.B xhost(1)	Xto grant access to the remote host.	X.SH OPTIONS	X.TP	X.BI \-l " username"	XUse	X.I username	Xas the remote username instead of your local username.  In the absence	Xof this option, the remote username is the same as your local username.	X	X.SH ENVIRONMENT	XIf set, the values of PATH, DISPLAY, XENVIRONMENT, XAPPLRESDIR,	XXFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, OPENWINHOME, LD_LIBRARY_PATH,	Xand XAUTHORITY are exported to the remote program, unless the	Xremote username is different, or the remote host is off-site, in which	Xcase only DISPLAY is exported, with in all cases any variables named in the	Xvariable RXENV.	X.PP	XThe DISPLAY variable is tweaked as appropriate, to contain as qualified	Xa hostname as is needed.	X.SH DIAGNOSTICS	X.TP	X.IB command ": don't recognise my name."	X.B rx	Xcannot decode the name it has been called under.  In this case	Xit prints a warning message, and continues, as normal.	X.TP	X.B "rx: usage: rx [-l username] hostname [args...]"	XThis means it could not decode the arguments given to it.	X.SH AUTHOR	XDuncan Sinclair <sinclair@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk>, July 1992	X.br	XOriginally based on a program with the same name from the	X.B gwm	Xdistribution.  To distinguish this "rx" from other programs	Xwith similar names, you should refer to this program as the	X.B Glasgow	X.BR rx .	X.SH "SEE ALSO"	XX(1), rsh(1), xterm(1), xauth(1), xhost(1), gwm(1)	X.SH BUGS	X.B Rx	Xmakes a number of assumptions about the relationship between the	Xlocal user, and the remote one, depending on whether the remote	Xhost is onsite or not, and whether an alternative username was used	Xor not.	X.PP	XIn particular, if either the locally used shell, or the remotely	Xused shell is the standard Bourne Shell,	X.B sh(1)	Xthen strange things are more likely to happen.  Especially when 	Xit's only one of them.	X.PP	XSometimes quoting can get messed up.	X.PP	XIt's too easy to fool the smarts in	X.B rx	Xto make it believe something that is not true, and fail because of it.	X.PP	XWhen	X.B rx	Xuses	X.B xhost	Xto grant access, the	X.B xhost	Xcommand may fail silently.	X.PP	XIf	X.B rx	Xtries to send to large a command to the remote machine, it will	Xlikely fail with a parse error from csh.  If this happens, you	Xwill probably have to reduce the size of the exported environment.

This means there	X#  are tons of implicit assumptions about the environment it is run in.	X#  These assumptions are all valid on the machines I use, and in my	X#  environment.  At the same time, I try to make as few assumptions as possible	X#  about the remote machine.  Here's a list of all the more tricky ones...	X# *) That the remote machine has csh.  (Linux?)	X# *) That $RSHELL = /bin/(k)?sh ==> remote shell = /bin/(k)?sh.  (Make same.)	X# *) If remote shell = sh, that $PATH is compatible.  (Use csh, etc..)	X# *) I pass a cookie to the remote machine if need be, but does it	X#    know what to do with a cookie. (eat it?)	X# *) There must be others...	X##############################################################################	X# Why am I using csh to run the remote commands?  Simply because it doesn't	X#  interact badly with rsh, and hang waiting for a file descriptor to	X#  be closed.  I'd rather use zsh, or bash, or even perl, but they are not	X#  as universal as csh.

	We are planning on buying 15-20 X Terminals.  I have the article from Jim	Morton regarding prices, etc., and am looking for any other information	that will help me decide which to buy.		The terminals will be connected to a DEC 3000/400 AXP with 96Mb RAM,	running OSF/1.  From what I have found out so far, it would be best to run	as much as possible in the terminal itself (X11, window manager, xterm,	etc.), and that in order to do this we need n Mb RAM in the Xterminal	(where n ranges from 4 to 10, depending on who I talk to).

	We are making a transition from NextStep to X-windows. I am trying to find the best GUI tool for our needs.  I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). I realize that there are differences but I don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. The tools I have looked at so far are UIM/X, X-designer, Tele-Use, tcl/tk,Interviews, and SUIT. 	So far I've drawn the following conclusions:		1) The builder for Interviews is not very mature, bad docs	2) Tele-Use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit	3) UIM/X & X-designer seem about the same, even though X-designer does not have a interpreter (I'll by Centerline if I need one)	4) tcl/tk is a little buggy	5) I know very little about the ICS Builder (just have the sales info)	6) Due to a corporate agreement X-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product.	7) For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them (well different money)	8) We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work	9) this type of tool seems great, but noone seems to talk about them on the net. Is there another news group for this ?	10) SUIT cost too much for comercial development.		I'm hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products.		thanks 		---	*	Bruce Trvalik  AOA-----------------*	*       (617)864-0201   check your mind at the door - The Band That Time Forgot	*	moose@aoa.utc.com	*       aoa!moose@bbn.com

	Hi,		I am using xdm on X11R5 with OW3 and Xview3 on Sun3s and SPARCs running 	SunOS 4.1.1.  Prior to using xdm, I used to set PATH and other environment	variables (like MANPATH, HELPPATH, ARCH, etc) in my .login file.  With xdm,	the .login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm	root-window nor my applications know about these variables.		I used the "DisplayManager._0.userPath" resource in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config	to succesfully pass the PATH variable.  But I am having problems passing anything else!!!  I tried execing $HOME/.login in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession	but that didn't help.  I also tried using		"DisplayManager.exportList: HELPPATH MANPATH ARCH"	which didn't work either.		I would appreciate any help on this matter.

A 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps	ethernet that we typically run.  How restrictive it will be depends on 	what you run and how you run it.

On the other hand, probably 50 xclocks quietly	updating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much.  In the real	world, you will be somewhere in between these two extremes.		Going by the way I personally use X on a daily basis, I wouldn't want to have	to share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people.		>>Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding	>>in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of	>>thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before	>>you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).	>	>Hmmm.

Our corporate WAN is as unique as any other.  The usage patterns are not very	good predictors of how yours will behave.  The only one of our low bandwidth	links that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they	often use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database 	remotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always	at this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview	X and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having	a long hop to the server.  As I warned you, this tells us very little about	how you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link.		Running Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent.	Let's break it into pieces and look at it.  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy	and efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a	little more involved and will generate some traffic.  Restoring the screen	that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be.  Does the server	that it's displaying on have backing store?  If so and the server had enough	memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network	traffic. If no backing store, then what was being covered up?  If it was a 	solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite	easily.  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send	it back to the X server bit by bit.  DVX will do its level best to only redraw	that small area, but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be 	repainted.  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits	that has to be sent.  Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds.	In reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts 	that will be tranlatable into higher level X calls.		>	>	>>It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going	>>to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all	>>doing network things also...)	>>-- 	>	>What do you mean by network things?

X was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network.  It's 	pretty good for this.  X programs are best, DOS text programs are almost	as good (since we conert them to X easily).  Something like WinX is a hybrid.	We intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver	keyboard driver and convert them to X.  The calls Windows is making are in	no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.  We go to a 	lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can, but	we are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications	tell us.		+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+	|   Quarterdeck Office Systems                    ____________________/_   |	|         Gary Rich - Problem Resolution Dept.    _________________///__\  |	|  _____________________________________________  ______________/////___\  |	|   Anonymous FTP site = qdeck.com                ___________///////____\  |	|          ---For---          ---Write to---      ________/////////_____\  |	|    Pricing/Ordering info :  info@qdeck.com      _____///////////______\  |	|     Technical Questions  : support@qdeck.com    __/////////////_______\  |	|         Quarterdeck BBS - (310) 314-3227        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  |	+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In the list you mentioned, tgif handles everything except rotation and	any size text.  It only supports 90 degrees rotation.  Currently, it	supports 11 (X11R4 standard) font sizes.  However, it allows arbitrary	scaling of the entire drawing.  Effectively, it allows any font sizes, but	you can only have 11 different sizes per drawing.		Tgif takes up 850K (compiled with -O option) on a SPARCstation.  I was told	that it compiles under Linux, but I haven't tried it yet.  It works with	both color and monochrome X.	-- 	Bill Cheng // UCLA Computer Science Department // (310) 645-8328	3564-C Boelter Hall // Los Angeles, California 90024 // USA	william@CS.UCLA.EDU      ...!{uunet|ucbvax}!cs.ucla.edu!william	
			Greetings,		We have a network of ~20 Sun Workstations, running SunOS 4.1.1	and Openwindows 3.  7 of these are Sun 3's that we have modified to	run Seth Robertson's xkernel image, effectively turning them into	xterminals.  We use xdm (X11R4) to manage the displays.			When we had 3 xkernel machines, things worked fine, but when	we installed 4 more last weekend, we appear to have found a weakness.	With 7 clients to 1 Sparc 2, the Sparc 2 window manager is eventually	getting munged.  			Let me try to be precise:  The user sitting at the machine	that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having	control of his keyboard and screen yanked away.  (When this was the	department chair, it was kind of cute).  We poked at xdm for a few	days and are satisfied that it is not at fault.  Our current theory is	that olwm (the Sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies	on one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm,	and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal	server). 			Has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior?		Can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory?		How about obvious gimmes?		And, of course, any ideas on how to solve it?			Any ideas are greatly appreciated.		  Greg Owen  { gowen@forte.cs.tufts.edu, gowen@jade.tufts.edu }	Systems Programmer and TA, Tufts University Computer Science Dept.

	We're looking at various X11 clients for PC's and we're looking for some	information about the relative efficiency of different products.  Are any	notably efficient (fast)?  Are any notably inefficient?  I assume that a	Graphics Accelerator makes them significantly faster (right now I'm looking	at ico running on Xoftware/32 for Windows sitting on the Distinct TCP/IP	platform, and it's (not surprisingly) much slower than ico running on the	Sparc10's console.  What are the key ways of improving performance for	PC (presumably Windows) clients?		Also, what about async solutions?  (Yes, I appreciate that it will be 	*much* slower even with V.42bis.)  I'm in the process of installing PPP	(with header compression).  How does that compare to cslip?  I've seen	a product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient, but	are there comparable products out there?  If we're looking for efficiency	for async, PC clients, what should we be looking at in addition to standard	PPP w/ compression and XRemote?		Any information would be greatly appreciated.  I'm still taking in all	the information in the faq, but any tips about the relative efficiency	of various product offerings would be great.  (I get the impression	that discussions about speed are largely application specific, but	that not withstanding, any comments would be appreciated.)

One usual suggestion is to put everything into your every-time shell rc-file	instead of your login-only one, which is fair enough if you only have a few	users who know what they're doing.  If you have several hundred users who do	what the books tell them, though, then it's confusing at best.  Another is to	have your xterms run login shells, but that still leaves the window manager	and the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment.		Our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts,	it runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell, and has *it* then run the	rest of the startup scripts.  That way the user's usual environment gets set	up as normal and inherited by everything.

In X10, the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing	requests;  that is, the server's drawing model was stateless.		This caused problems with performance and network traffic,	so the X11 redesign included the graphic context to codify	the drawing state.  Most application designers who want to	draw things in several different colors create a GC for	each color during initialization, then pass the GC id in	each drawing request.

	Hi all,		I wrote a small application which uses pixmaps copied into a window	to show some drawings. This works perfectly for all kind of objects	expect large fonts. What happens on the screen is that the right	half of the font is not shown. The way I create these things is	quite simple; some aggregated code:		XFillRectangle(Disp, Pixs, AnyColor, 0, 0, Width, Height);	XDraw[Line|Rect|String](...);	XCopyArea(Disp, Pixs, Win, 0, 0, Width, Height, 0, 0);		I am using a RS6K 340 with BOS 3.2.		The question is:	  is this a bug in the AIX X-server (may be some PTFs), or did I do	  something wrong within my code??		Sorry for the cross-posting, but I really do not know what kind of	error it is.			Juergen Schietke	Research Insitute for Discrete Mathematics	University of Bonn	Nassestr. 2	5300 Bonn 1 (Germany)

Anyway, what you say is not really true. The color information	is associated with a GraphicsContext, not with a display, and the GC _IS_	a parameter to the drawing routines.		So, if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of	width 2, you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do		XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_red,x1,y1,x2,y2);	XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_blue,x3,y3,x4,y4);		for this effect.		This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer, but also much	more efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameters	like line pattern, with, cap and joinstyle, drawmode and so on in every	drawing call, so why do it for color ? BTW, stay away from XDrawPoint()	if you don't really need it (to draw RANDOM points), for image transfers	there are Image routines.		--	+-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+	| o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o |	| o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o |	| o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o |	+-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+

		I have the task to program a X application for the first time and have some severe difficulties creating a window in which I can draw something.	Unfortunately some basic books on the topic of X application programming are not available to me for the moment.		I am running a hp720 with hpux 8.07, VUE and X11R4 using Xt anbd Xaw.		What I did until now:	I initialized the X Intrinsics cxreating a top level widget with XtAppInitialize. I passed as a application_class name 'commandWidgetClass'.	Then I set the argument values for window height and width using XtSetArg and	passed it to the toplevel widget with XtSetValues.	When I call XtRealizeWidget, I get a window of the specified size, but I have no idea how I can draw something in it.		Can anybody send me some help and perhaps some basic information how to use the widgets ?	In which situation it is useful to use them and in which not ?

		The Only directory I know of that lists commercial and non-commercial	widgets is the ICS Widget Data book.  ICS sells the widgets for various	prices.

The ICS Widget databook is a subscription kind of thing, where 	you pay some nominal fee, get a cd with the widgets and then you 	can use the public domain widgets freely, and selectively activate 	widgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them. 	The nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets	such as those used in dataviews.

	I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on	export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).		The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike	in the major version number, is:		  o undo has been implemented.		    By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is	    provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,	    levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is	    supported.		There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)		                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-		For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of	what it is all about:		aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant	improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it	features, amongst other things,		   o multiple windows	   o multiple buffers	   o default menu interface	   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons 	     under user control	   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters	   o provision for defining a keyboard macro	   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters	   o file selection via a browser	   o knowledge of line numbers	   o parenthesis matching	   o regular expression searching	   o restricted or unlimited undo	   o ability to change font	   o easy entry of control codes	   o xterm-like keymap feature	   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)	   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help	   o server mode with cooperating client programs	   o optional extension language using Tcl	   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability	   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe		I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and	Xaw3d options, on the following systems:		   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5	   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5	   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5	   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5	   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5	   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5	   	but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have	only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.		A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been	incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is	provided for those systems that do not have one.		Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been	encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under	R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known	problems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If	it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,	2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as	many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only	that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of	aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2	never got converted to make use of it.		aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)	and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due	course from several other ftp sites.  Check your nearest using	xarchie.		If you can't ftp, try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the	word "help" alone in your message body.

		              Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists	              ---------------------------------------------	   	   Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful	   information on SCO Open Desktop since 1990 through the ancestral USENET	   newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it's companion mailing list.  Similarly,	   there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum	   for SCO products in general.	   	   With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO	   newsgroups, many current contributors including those who have been	   active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt	   that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.*	   hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide.		   biz.sco.{opendesktop,general,announce} were newgrouped May 1, 1991 in	   accordance with accepted procedure within "biz".  Given the content,	   this change relocated the "opendesktop" newsgroup to a more proper place	   within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new "announce"	   and "general" groups.  On Aug 1, 1991, the former "sco-list@uunet.uu.net"	   became "scogen" in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions.		   biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1, 1992	   to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix, UNIX and OpenDesktop specific	   binaries and source code.  The binaries and sources news groups are	   moderated, with moderator and submissions information and policy	   outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups.	   Respecting USENET etiquite, these newsgroups are _not_ gated to	   mailing lists, but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts.		   biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14, 1992, to provide a discussion	   area for the readers, writers and publishers of SCO Magazine.	   	   Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed,	   you are now able to subscribe to the following:	   	        Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription	        ---------                    -------------------------	        biz.sco.opendesktop          scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca	        biz.sco.general              scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca	        biz.sco.announce             scoann-request@xenitec.on.ca		biz.sco.sources			<none>		biz.sco.binaries		<none>		biz.sco.magazine	     scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca		   You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET	   NEWS mechanisms vrs mail.  Anyone having difficulty arranging a news	   feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and	   I'll do my best to help.  We also offer all required software in	   source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP, as do many archive sites.	   If, after having explored all options, you are still unable to receive	   biz.sco.* as news, you may subscribe to the mailing lists.	   	   The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion	   mailing lists, so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a	   UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email.	   Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate	   "mailing list subscription" address above, including in the message body:			Add: subscriber_address		-eg-		Add: your_logname@site.do.main  -or-		Add: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname		   Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know	   major functional site might prove beneficial.  Deletions are handled	   the same way, simply substitute "Delete:" for "Add:", ensuring that	   you use the exact same address you subscribed with.  Mailing list	   subscribers receive "how to post to the mlist" article submission	   information when their request is processed.  If you don't receive	   an acknowledgement within a few days, check your routing and try a test	   message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host.  In such cases, it's likely	   that someone, somewhere, is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do	   the same with mailing list traffic), and you'll want to resolve your	   connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again.  Mailing list	   subscriptions are free, subject to whatever arrangements you may have	   with the site(s) feeding you.	   	   Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged	   drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists, this indicates that we	   are no longer able to find a working route to your site.  We loose a	   handful of subscribers this way each month.  If this happens to you,	   please email us your known working bang-path relative to a major site.		   What's in the newsgroups (and mailing_lists where applicable):	   	   biz.sco.opendesktop: Technical questions and answers and informative	                        postings relating to past, present, and future	                        implementations of the SCO OpenDeskTop operating	                        environment and it's various bundled components.	   	   biz.sco.general:     Questions, answers and comments on SCO products	                        in general, and of course resulting discussions.	   	   biz.sco.announce:    SCO and SCO Developer product announcements of				interest to current and future users of SCO products,				and to SCO developers, resellers and distributors.

	We are adding a Motif wrapper to a family of data display programs.		These programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps:	- use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data	  otherwise block (new data comes quite often)	- use msgop to check for messages and if true read them	  otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often)	- update the display according to latest data and messages.		We typically have several of these running in windows,	plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag.	Everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run.		Xt and Xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into.	O'Reilly Vol IV Ch 9 discusses adding a file-watcher and also	how to add workprocs that are run during idle time.		We can 'open-up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc.	The problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate.	Neither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt.		The unix select call lets you block until any of several i/o are ready.	We want that for the X main loop except not file i/o.	Any suggestions or examples most welcome!		We run SGI Personal Iris and Indigo systems.		Morris Hirsch aka morris@sg25.nusc.navy.mil or 401 841 7800

You have to run up the window heirarchy (using XQueryTree()) until you get	to the root window.  Now, this is not so simple because some window managers	slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window,	so be sure to take that into account for further calculations.		Calculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using	XGetGeometry().  BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION.	Remember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window, so the	windows x,y,width,height must be adjusted accordingly.		All of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the	window-manager is using.		Now, to place the new window, you have to use the same numbers to calculate 	where you want to place it, because the window-manager will re-parent it on	the OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly).		I did get it working under several window managers correctly.  Feel free to	call or e-mail for further info.		              -McGary		-- 	Mike D.

	I have been using a HDS X-terminal, and really like it. What	is really powerful is that it can run the X server without	running a window manager. One can then run a special client	X program called a window manager, either (1) run 	motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network	traffic - but having no HOME). or (2) run motif or openlook	from some home place (like a sparc, or vms).		This is powerful, especially since I can exit one window manager	(without killing windows) and then start up another manager.	(Some of my VMS tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in	one manager and not the other).		Well the question is:		  On a sparcstation running openlook, does anyone know how to	  break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program? Basically I	  want to run only the server, and go somewhere else to run	  the window manager.		---	Please respond my e-mail (as well as posting) because of the	large volumes in window.X)		Thanks.				-- 	Scott Moody   (206) 773-4313   "There are no answers .. just cross references"	     scott@shuksan.boeing.com  	     uunet!bcstec!shuksan!scott

I use it all day every day (maintaining our ftp site and answering mail	via support@qdeck.com), and I can honestly say that in the last few	months I've never had my machine go down due to any sort of tcpip network	manager instability. (Of course, I've crashed my machine quite a few times	on purpose, during beta testing and that sort of thing, but the tcpip	portion is quite stable...)		However, keep in mind that DVX and the network managers are only going	to be as stable as the software they sit on top of (so if your underlying	network kernel is flakey, you can't expect DVX to be terribly stable...)		>2) how does it send the information from a MS Windows app over	>the X11 protocol?

(To vastly	over-simplify what goes on, we just take the windows graphics API calls,	and translate them directly to X-protocol; unfortunately, windows was	not really written to be network-aware, so sometimes we see a speed	penalty when an app does something stupid, like sending a big white bitmap	to erase something rather than just drawing a white box; fortunately,	that sort of thing is rare...)		>3) If I want to run MS Word, for example, remotely, do I have to	>run a separate copy of MS Windows remotely, and then start MS	>Word from that, or can MS Word be started remotely on its own?

              at Oracle Corporation.  The opinions expressed are those	              of the user and not necessarily those of Oracle.		I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing	/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers from:	:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100	to:	:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85		I determined that my 19" 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the	active screen area and dividing by resolution.		However, this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely.	After some research, I believe this is caused by my applications	requesting fonts by Family, Weight, Slant, and Pointsize.  I believe	that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics	and displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my	path, the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts, but	not for the family I am using (Helvetica).		I think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in the	resolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless you	explicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both the	scaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance, the command		xfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'		Will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font).		The command  		xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'		Will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path).	Despite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can	generate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies a	resolution, X appears to pick a stupid default.		Is this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so, why?  Is there anything I can	do to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie about	my resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both).	This would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able to	look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: "Yup, thats	an inch".  Anyone have a set of 85dpi bitmapped fonts I can use?

So, use XCreateColormap() with the proper visual and use it	in SetWinAttrib (and don't forget the mask!).		And the inevitable caveat: I usually use widgets, setting the visual	and colormap resources rather than direct X routines, so I could be	wrong. But, I think this is the general difficulty.

	I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on	export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).		The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike	in the major version number, is:		  o undo has been implemented.		    By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is	    provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,	    levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is	    supported.		There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)		                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-		For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of	what it is all about:		aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant	improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it	features, amongst other things,		   o multiple windows	   o multiple buffers	   o default menu interface	   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons 	     under user control	   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters	   o provision for defining a keyboard macro	   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters	   o file selection via a browser	   o knowledge of line numbers	   o parenthesis matching	   o regular expression searching	   o restricted or unlimited undo	   o ability to change font	   o easy entry of control codes	   o xterm-like keymap feature	   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)	   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help	   o server mode with cooperating client programs	   o optional extension language using Tcl	   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability	   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe		I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and	Xaw3d options, on the following systems:		   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5	   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5	   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5	   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5	   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5	   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5	   	but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have	only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.		A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been	incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is	provided for those systems that do not have one.		Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been	encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under	R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known	problems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If	it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,	2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as	many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only	that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of	aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2	never got converted to make use of it.		aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)	and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due	course from several other ftp sites.  Check your nearest using	xarchie.		If you can't ftp, try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the	word "help" alone in your message body.

Thanks.		The x3270 at export.lcs.mit.edu supposedly does.  I use another x3270	that was cleaned up by Brian Ward <ward@math.psu.edu> which adds better	color support, and cleans up _lots_ of bugs, as well as cut&paste.	I just put it on export.lcs.mit.edu, as x3270v2.65beta.tar.Z.		--Dave	-- 	System Administrator, Penn State Population Research Institute	End of article 2565 (of 2565)--what next? [npq]

	Given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or	modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice, I would	say that the shareware notice is unenforceable.  All you need to do is	make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed	under the first part of the copyright notice.  Of course, this would be	circumventing the author's wishes on the subject, but I'd say if you're	not going to pay him no matter what, you'd be on relatively safe ground	with that approach...  In fact, given the internal contradictions of the	copyright notices, I'd guess none of it could ever be enforced, but not being	a lawyer, I can't be positive.		Regardless, the fees he's asking are not excessive, and I would encourage	anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible.  Even	though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the	author, it would be reasonable to do so, to support his efforts if nothing	else.		- Brad		-- 	Brad Daniels		`	|  "If money can't buy happiness,	daniels@neosoft.com		|   I guess I'll have to rent it."

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers)	=====================================================================		I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?		1. Free options		The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.		Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will		be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86		is listed below.			X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was		done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).		It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.		There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,		X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you		don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).		X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).		2. Commercial options		     1) Metro Link		2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?		3. What is XFree86?		   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with	   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and	   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:		    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,	       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require	       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of	       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by	       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield	       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.	    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default	       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now	       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately	       20% faster than X386 1.2.	    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,	       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4	       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from	       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.	    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.	       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about	       the ATI and Trident drivers.	    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's	       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).	    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is	       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the	       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.	    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font	       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary	       distributions.	    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.	    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA	       cards is now included.		   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2	   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):		    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of	       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 	       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).	    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the	       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a "two	       headed" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only	       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).	    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.	    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to	       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for	       more information.)	    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some 	       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).	    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor	       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous	       documentation and a lot of experimentation).	    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including	       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many 	       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more 	       information).	    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has	       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of	       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks	       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.	    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig	       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative	       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new	       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) 	       manual page for more information on the format of this file).		       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file	       in the source distribution for full details.		   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the	   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.		4. What OSs are supported?		    XFree86 supports:		SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2		SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC		SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2		Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1			BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active		BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.			Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,		but anyone should feel free to submit patches.		If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to		xfree86@physics.su.oz.au		5. What video hardware is supported?		   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:			Tseng ET4000		Tseng ET3000		Paradise PVGA1		Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of			the PVGA1, and use its driver)		Genoa GVGA		Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000		ATI 18800, 28800			All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,		with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in		256 color mode.			The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of		video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the		ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome		server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.			It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to		non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To		avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86		1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel		clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are		discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how		these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such		a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with		future XFree86 releases.			If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,		it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the		Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not		work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.		In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond		products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions		of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).		If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.			Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA		video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the		CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It		could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset		on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot		of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested		theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not		working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86		working fine on them.		6. What about accelerated boards?			At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards		like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available		in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).			An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact		<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.			A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>		or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.		7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?			The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the		16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory		contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-		planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each		of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-		buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled		16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code		could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).		But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer		implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,		but nothing is yet available from the project.		8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?			Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run		X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.		The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending		on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).		To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will		be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable 		lower bound.		9. Where can I get source for XFree86?			Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22		from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:			export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)			ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)			ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)		(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)			Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information		on which files you need to get to build your distribution.		10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?			Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:			ftp.physics.su.oz.au		- SVR4 binaries				under /XFree86/SVR4			ftp.win.tue.nl			- SVR4 binaries				under /pub/XFree86/SVR4			ferkel.ucsb.edu			- SVR4 binaries				under /pub/SVR4/XFree86			stasi.bradley.edu		- SVR4 binaries				under /pub/XFree86/SVR4			blancmange.ma.utexas.edu	- SVR3 (ISC) binaries				under /pub/ISC			ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries				under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86			tsx-11.mit.edu			- Linux binaries				under /pub/linux/packages/X11			agate.berkeley.edu		- 386BSD binaries				under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86			ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- Mach binaries				under /i386			Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may		archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will		contain a README file that describes what files you need to take		from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were		made when building the distribution.		IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?		11. Installation directories			The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot		(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include		files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.			This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified		via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is		nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed		alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.		12. Configuration files			The XFree86 server reads a configuration file ("Xconfig") on startup.		The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in		the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.		13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes			David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known		clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.		The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and		is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is		also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on		export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated		occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the		settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to		David for inclusion in the database.			If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file 		with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.		It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use		this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information		to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.			NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and		      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot		      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from		      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The		      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.		      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your		      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up		      starting the server in the future.		14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit			If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to		reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is		fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.		V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?			First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).		15. SVR4		Why won't my xterm run properly?			If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define		CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.		csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'			The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping		problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be		installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.		16. SVR3			Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.		17. 386BSD			Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.			Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey		<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the		file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:			    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2		    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2		    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2		18. Linux			You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc		jump libraries installed.			Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.			If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to		run the server as "X -pn". The default startup configuration assumes		that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files		/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the		-pn argument to X386.			Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major		number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not		owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit		console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but		startx won't.			When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with		a tty, for example "xdm < /dev/console &".			For more detailed information, please read the file README present		with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.		19. Mach			Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.		VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?			This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is		fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.		Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.		VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?		20. BSD compatibility library			A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.		The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a		which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),		seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include		<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro		definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are		linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these		functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a		21. ANSICCOPTIONS			This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the		ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite		the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see		something like			CCOPTIONS="-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings"		and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put			CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"		in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of			ANSICCOPTIONS="-ansi"			CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"		and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:			ANSICCOPTIONS=		to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death		with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because		CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must		add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.

		Frequently-asked questions about the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface.		If your question isn't here, please try (at *least*)		man openwin		man xnews		man 7 xview	and looking in the appropriate manuals listed in the Bibliography below	before posting to the comp.windows.open-look, comp.windows.x or	alt.toolkits.xview newsgroups and/or their corresponding mailing lists.		Special Notes:	    * I have not updated this FAQ for the recently-announced OpenWindows 4,	      due to ship later this year.	    * Yes, Sun is moving to Motif, along with all of COSE.  But the Motif to	      which they move will be a new Motif, with some of the OPEN LOOK UI	      features added.	    * Yes, OpenWindows 4 will use DPS instead of NeWS.  NeWS is dead.	      This means TNT is dead, too.	    * XView and OLIT will be supported, but probably not enhanced after the	      next release.  I don't know if there will be a source release of	      XView 3.1 or not.	    * The COSE Environment will include at least some of Sun's DeskSet,	      ported to Motif.  Look for Calendar Manager and Mailtool, at least.	    * Yes, the new Mailtool will be MIME-compliant.		Frequently Asked Questions for X11 are posted to comp.windows.x monthly.

OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).	    A GUI determines the `look and feel' of a system -- the shape of	    windows, buttons and scroll-bars, how you resize things, how you	    edit files, etc.		    The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified, developed and maintained jointly by	    Sun Microsystems and AT&T (or USL?).		    See Also:		Bibliography		@ What is OpenWindows?	    OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK	    Graphical User Interface Specifications.  It's compatible with the	    X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView,	    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.	    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.	    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the	    program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.	    It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook', as	    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.	    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,	    plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.	    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are:		SunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0		Solaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0		Solaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1		    See Also:		Mixing X11 and OpenWindows		Where can I get it?		@ What are OLIT, XView and TNT?	    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs	    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography	    for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary:		    OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;	    it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were	    already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,	    although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the	    OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in	    System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in	    OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a	    division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).	    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably	    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or	    anything else that uses subclasses.	    [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]		    XView is Sun's toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in	    programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help	    migrate source code from SunView to XView.	 XView is often said to be	    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.	    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is	    available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).	    The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.	    Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the	    XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be	    included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.	    On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much	    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.		    The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based	    on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the	    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of	    an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows.		    The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some	    incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to	    supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time	    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.	    You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the	    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.	    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.		    The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++	    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from	    DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify	    event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be	    compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the	    release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.	    UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of	    various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in	    the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).		@ Where does Motif fit in?	    It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that	    is being developed by OSF.	It has a `look and feel' reminiscent of	    Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-	    commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold	    reasonably cheaply by OSF.	Although Motif is currently available on	    more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly	    used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a	    large installed base.	    Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif	    applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in	    the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable.		@ What is MoOLIT?	    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between	    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V	    Release 4.2.	    Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677		@ What about that Display PostScript thing?	    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X	    in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed	    hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a	    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously	    being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it	    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less	    complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.	    Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work;	    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.	    Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS	    extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to	    ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.	    (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts	    available, however)			@ What are olwm and olvwm?	    They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window	    system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows	    on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows.		    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.	    It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and	    you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.		    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the	    `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the	    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.	 You can	    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This	    lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around	    from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm	    by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.	    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib	    directory; there are three patches).		@ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?	    Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use	    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the	    footers some windows use to display certain messages.		    If you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus	    and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run	    under olwm.	    For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc:		LeftTitleButton "target" = f.delete	    where "target" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.	    Alternatively, try		# Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm		LeftTitleButton ":menu" = f.menu "OL.menu"			menu "OL.menu" {		    "Quit"         f.delete		}		    For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title	    bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).		    See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).			@ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal?	    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.	    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.	    Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS	    or SunView support, and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes	    pageview in particular.		    You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-	    Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)	    will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about	    fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.	    If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you	    may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's	    XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help.			     	@ What configuration files do I need to know about?		    .xinitrc and .xsessionrc		    The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in	    your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to	    edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files	    you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.		    If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,	    since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file.		    .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys		    These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,	    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.	    Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files	    without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need	    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an	    X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,	    shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's "contool" program so that	    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.	    Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.		    .Xdefaults		    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular,	    it is a good idea to include at least:		OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true		*Input: TRUE	    These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they	    forget to ask for it.		    Props, the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default	    root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults.	    Don't put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props' deletes them.		    .startup.ps		    This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews)	    on startup.	 This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the	    back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change	    the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a	    syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up	    at all or will get broken in strange ways.	The NeWS manual gives code	    that is both incorrect and insufficient.	    WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.		    Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see	    the man page for xset ("man xset", and "xset -help") for more information.		    Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of	    about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of	    twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for	    OpenWindows 3.  You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime	    is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn't include the time to	    process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your	    SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again, this is for OpenWindows 3...			% don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual		% /IncludeDemos? false def			UserProfile begin		    /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def		    /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def		    % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly...		end		    You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this:			/NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage		/TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage		/TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage			ClassRepeatKeys pop	% force repeat.ps to autoload			endpackage endpackage endpackage		    If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the	    OpenWindows server like this:		$ psh -i .startup.ps		Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3		$ psh -i		Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3		/classinit ClassRepeatKeys send		%%% now press control-D		    You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make	    the root window be "retained", so that a PostScript drawing on the	    background won't be erased when you move windows:		frambuffer /Retained true put	    will do this.  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used	    by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically.	    	    See also:		Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type		Trouble Shooting: Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults?		Environment Variables		@ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard?	    You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one	    or two occasional surprises.  See also "man 7 xview" for a list of	    keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs.		    With OpenWindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings	    and then let SunView handle them.  The status returned by svenv should	    tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this	    in your .xinitrc:		    if eval `svenv -env`	    then		xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3"		input_from_defaults	    else		xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"	    fi			@ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle?		    Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but	    effective screen saver.  See `man screenblank'.	    Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as	    it's not supplied.  Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system	    run screenblank automatically.			@ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs?		    To go from XTerm to textedit (say):	    * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button	      in xterm	    * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6, or Meta+c (the O'Reilly	      XView manual gets this wrong)	    * Move to the textedit window, and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v)		    If this doesn't work, see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste		   To go the other way, from textedit to XTerm:	    * Select the text in textedit.  No need to use COPY	    * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button).	    * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons.		@ COPY/PASTE is boring.	 What short-cuts are available?		    Quick Copy within textedit, mailtool, etc:	    * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go	    * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button	    * Select the text you want to copy/move.  You'll see that it's underlined	      or crossed out, as appropriate.  (In the jed demo it goes grey)	    * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button.	    * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret.		    Drag and Drop to Move a Selection	    * Select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple-	      clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button	    * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection	    * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button, and move the mouse	      pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the	      first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon).	    * Still holding SELECT down, move the mouse over the point where you want	      to drop the text	    * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show	      that it's OK to drop things here	    * Let go of SELECT, and the text is moved.	This works in text fields of	      dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows.		    Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection	    * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection, except that	      you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button.		@ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere?		    See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.	    In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when	    shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the	    right of the insert point.			Meta-i - include file	    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward)			Ctrl-a - start of line	    Ctrl-< - back word		Ctrl-e - end of line	    Ctrl-> - forward word		Ctrl-w - delete word	    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line		Ctrl-Return - move to end/START of document		    See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default	    keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.		@ What can I put in my .ttysrc?	 Where is it documented?		    See the manual page for shelltool.		    Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide,	    which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_	    Catalyst listing of products for Suns, updated six-monthly.		    Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular	    OPEN LOOK applications.  Often you can simply contact the vendor	    concerned to have the license upgraded from demo, and receive the full	    product documentation.		    SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users, Printer's Pallate, which	    contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters, as	    well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license.		    There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists	    a number of free and commercial aplications; mail lee@sq.com for a	    copy, including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a	    faster reply.			@ Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)?	    Yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages.	    If "man cm_delete" doesn't work or gives strange messages, see under	    Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages, below.		@ How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail?	    The best way is:	    $ cd	    $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc .	    $ chmod +w .textswrc	    edit .textswrc (use vi, textedit, or whatever you prefer)	    add the follwing:		KEY_RIGHT(3)    FILTER		cat ~/.signature	    (you might need to change ~ to $HOME)		    Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file.					@ Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts?	    Yes, under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which).	    Or, Not Yet, in other words.		    If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them, I'm told.	    The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted, though, and	    comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is	    interesting...  The F3 font format is described in a publication from the	    Sun OpenFonts group, listed in the Bibliography below.  Documentation on	    the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts.		    You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS, Monotype, Linotype, URW and probably	    other major foundries.		    SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts.		@ Improving font rendering time	    Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast, it's not as	    fast as loading a bitmap :-).  You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes	    that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache	    parameters.	 If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the	    font cache size.		$ psh -i		Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at you		currentfontmem =	% type this line ...		300	% and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes		1024 setfontmem		% Just to check:		currentfontmem =		1024	    See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide.  You need to say psh -i	    so that the PostScript packages are loaded - see the psh man page.		@ Making bitmap fonts for faster startup:		$ mkdir $HOME/myfonts		$ cd $HOME/myfonts		$ makeafb -20 -M $OPENWINHOME/lib/fonts/Bembo.f3b		Creating Bembo20.afb		$ convertfont -b Bembo20.afb		Bembo20.afb->./Bembo20.fb		Chars parameter greater than number of characters supplied.		$ ls		Bembo20.afb	Bembo20.fb	Synonyms.list		$ bldfamily		* Bembo		       ./Bembo.ff (Encoding: latin)		cat: ./Compat.list: No such file or directory		$ xset +fp `pwd`		$ xset fp rehash		    If you want the server to see your new font directory every time,	    add this directory to your FONTPATH environment variable in one	    of your start-up files, e.g. .login or .profile.		@ Converting between font formats (convertfont, etc.)	    You can also use Folio fonts with an X11 server, by converting them to a	    bitmap (X11 bdf format) first.  Your licence forbids you from using the	    fonts on another machine, and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldn't	    use them for printing.  Having said all that...  you can use makeafb and	    convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or	    bdftopcf.		    Use mftobdf (from the SeeTeX distribution) to convert TeX pk fonts to	    X11 bdf format, which you can then use with either X11 or OenWindows.		    You can also use der Mouse's "getbdf" to get bdf fonts from a running	    X display server -- ftp: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) /X/getbdf		@ Xview/OLIT fonts at 100 dpi	    There aren't any.  More precisely, the various text fonts, such as	    Lucida Typewriter Sans, are available at 100 dpi, and in fact are	    scalable under OpenWindows.	 The glyph fonts are bitmaps, and don't	    scale very well.			@ No manual entry for cm_lookup		    If man doesn't seem to find OpenWindows commands, even though you are	    running OpenWindows, try setting the MANPATH environment variable:		MANPATH=$OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man; export MANPATH	    or		setenv MANPATH $OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man	    for csh users.  $OPENWINHOME should be /usr/openwin on most systems.		@ window: Window creation failed to get new fd 	@ window: Base frame not passed parent window in environment 	@ Cannot create base frame.  Process aborted. 		    These messages all come from SunView programs.  SunView was an	    earlier windowing system for Suns, and was not networked.  Some of	    the SunView programs are still around in /usr/bin, and have names	    that are the same as their OpenWindows counterparts.  You almost	    certainly want to run the programs in $OPENWINHOME instead.		    Set your path so that $OPENWINHOME/bin (and $OPENWIN/bin/xview for	    OpenWindows 2) come before /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same), or	    you'll get the SunView versions of mailtool, cmdtool, shelltool, etc.		@ memory fault - core dumped	    If you get this from the binder, or if binder vanishes suddenly,	    get the following patches:		100493-02 Binder		100524-03 Cetables		100626-03 Tooltalk		@ Trouble compiling Xt, Xmu or OLIT programs: _get_wmShellWidgetClass	 	    If you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), contact your local	    Sun office and request the following patches:	100512-02   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch	100573-03   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libXmu		    If you can't install the patch, a workaround is to add 		-u get_wmShellWidgetClass -u get_applicationShellWidgetClass	    on the link (ld or cc ... -o ...) line.  An alternative is to add		-assert nodefinitions	    to CFLAGS in your Makefile, or even in Imake.tmpl.				@ When I try to type into some programs, I just get beeps or nothing happens	    It is a good idea to include at least:		OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true		*Input: TRUE	    in your .Xdefaults file, as these allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to	    receive input even if they forget to ask for it.	    See the next item for editing .Xdefaults			@ I can't paste from xterm to XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs	    Under OpenWindows 2, you need to add the following either to your	    $HOME/.Xdefaults file, or to $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm instead:			XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override \			<Key>L6:select-set(CLIPBOARD)\n\			<Key>L8:insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)	  	    You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing	    L8 (the Paste key)!		    Under OpenWindows 3, this is already in the app-defaults file, so if it	    isn't working, check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to		/usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S	    and if it isn't, either set it or copy/merge the above lines from	    $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.	    [See also: Environment Variables]		    This version automatically puts each xterm selection onto the clipboard:		XTerm*VT100.translations: #override\n\		    ~Ctrl ~Meta<Btn2Up>: insert-selection(PRIMARY,CUT_BUFFER0)\n\		    ~Ctrl ~Meta<BtnUp>: select-end(PRIMARY,CUT_BUFFER0,CLIPBOARD)\n\		    <KeyPress>L8: insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)	    [Note: be sure that the \n\ is at the very end of the line, there must	     be no following spaces, and any + or | signs showing that this FAQ file	     was altered must also be removed!]		    If you are using X11R5, you may find that adding the lines	<Key>L10: start-extend() select-end(PRIMARY, CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER0)\n\	       <KeyRelease>L10: kill-selection() \n	    before the <KeyPress>L8 line will make L10 (CUT) work as a cut key!		    If you alter $HOME/.Xdefaults instead, you must use what X calls a	    `more specific' resource name:		xterm.vt100.translations	    will do.		@ I can't paste from XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs to xterm		    If you don't have the Sun L keys on the left of your keyboard, you can	    use Meta-x, Meta-c and Meta-v for cut, coy and paste respectively.	    You can change the keys by adding the following two lines to	    your .Xdefaults file, edited as you wish (the values shown here are the	    defaults):			Openwindows.KeyboardCommand.Copy: c+Meta,L6		OpenWindows.KeyboardCommand.Paste", "v+Meta,L8	    	    Lists of resources are in the manual page for xview, and also in the	    thinnish blue book `Companion to Volume 7, XView Reference Manual' from	    O'Reilly, and also in the olwm and olvwm manual pages.		@ I always get the same piece of text when I press PASTE (L8, Meta+v)	    Remove the file /tmp/textsw_shelf and see if that helps; see also the	    next item.		@ Cut Copy and Paste don't work at all (OpenWindows only)	    Oh dear.  Use ps -xuaww | grep xv  to check that sv_xv_sel_svc is running	    and that either you or root started it, depending on whether you started	    OpenWindows with "openwin" or by logging in through xdm.	    If not, start it.  If it dies, check that there is no /tmp/.sv_xv_sel_svc	    before restarting it - you may need to be root to remove it, or you can	    reboot your workstation.	    Check that there is space in /tmp (use "df /tmp"), and also see if there	    are a lot of files there with names like /tmp/tty.txt.a01246; if there are	    several hundred of them, cut and paste may take so long that it times out.		    Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool, filemgr and cm (calendar), start	    a terminal emulator and remove and /tmp/tty.txt* and /tmp/Text* files	    that are still there.  It's simplest to quit openwin and start it again	    after doing that, if cut and paste was broken, but if it starts working	    again you can just carry on.  Note that files in /tmp not owned by you	    might be in use by another worker comrade, so don't remove those without	    checking first!			    If you get error messages that look like		Xlib:  connection to ":0.0" refused by server		Xlib:  Internal error during connection authorization check		Error: Can't Open display	    try, on the machine running OpenWindows or X11,		xhost +machine	    where "machine" is the computer on which you ran the command that failed.	    If you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you,	    using your display, you will have to type the bizarre-looking		xhost +`hostname`	    (or xhost +happyboy, if happyboy is the name of your workstation).	    This lets ANY user on `happyboy' access your display.		    With OpenWindows 3.0 you can also use xauth, and the Programmer's Guide 	    describes how to do this in Chapter 8, p. 101.  This is more secure.	    Also check the man page for fbtab(5) to stop other users accessing the	    framebuffer directly!		    Also note that there is a Sun patch for OpenWindows 3.0 under SunOS 4.1.1	    to fix a serious security problem.  It is available through your local	    Sun Answer Center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net	    [192.48.96.2] system in /sun-dist:	    Fix                     PatchID        Filename            Checksum	    loadmodule              1076118        100448-01.tar.Z     04354  5			    On an X Terminal, there may be a setup menu that lets you change or	    disable the list of hosts that can access the display.		    If you start getting this message after you've been logged in overnight,	    there might be a cron job that's removing the Unix sockets in /tmp	    that are used to communicate with the server when $DISPLAY doesn't have	    a hostname before the :, or is empty.  Have the system administrator	    change the cron script to skip sockets.			@ I get console error messages on my screen and they don't go away (Sun 3 or 4)	    If "refresh" makes the messages vanish, but new ones come along later,		you need to run "xterm -C" from your .xinitrc, or start one up in		the background and then  choose Save Workspace from the		Workspace->Utilities menu.  Better still, pick up "contool" and run		that.  Get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory.  It		will monitor the console and open, flash its icon or beep when a		message appears; it's very easy to configure.		    If "refresh" from the Workspace->Utilities menu doesn't make the messages,	    go away...		a Sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens - you can move the		mouse off the right-hand (by default) edge of the screen and onto		a whole new (but monochrome) display, called ":0.1".  See the man.		page for openwin; I have a shell script that checks for this and,		if there's a /dev/cgfour0, does			openwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0		If you are running X11 or OpenWindows 2, you might need to add this		to your .xinitrc or other startup file:		(		    eval `svenv -display unix:0.1 -env`		    olvwm -display unix:0.1		) &		Later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically.		You can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messages.  Also, see		the note about contool, above.		@ Is there an easy way of editing .Xdefaults?	    Use `props', which appears in the default root menu as `properties'.	    This starts `props', a property editor which will re-write your	    .Xdefaults after removing comments.  It then applies any changes.	    Keep comments by using "comment." instead of "!", for example,		comment.*.font: Palatino-Italic-37		@ How do I get the File manager to use emacs instead of textedit?	    set the default editor to		sh -c "exec emacs -font lucidasanstypewriter-18 \"$FILE\""	    (you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one)		@ How do I run OpenWindows in inverse video?	    This tends not to work under OpenWindows 2.	 With OpwnWindows 3.0,	    there are various ways, including using -bg and -fg options.  If you're	    using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of	    upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.		@ Why don't flat check-boxes work?	    A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these.	    A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it's only Guide's output	    that's broken, not the actual check-box code.	    This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.  If you're	    still using an ancient DevGuide, you should upgrade as soon as possible;	    the new one is fantastic!		@ When I leave OpenWindows, my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays	  on the screen.	    Try running clear_colormap; if this helps, put it as the last line in	    the shell script you use to start OpenWindows (e.g. `openwin').		@ When I use snapshot, the system crashes, or the server hangs, or something.	    This was a bug related to some systems only.  The only work-round was to	    use some other screen dump program, such as xwd, xv 2.21 or xgrabsc.	    	@ Why have some of my function keys stopped working?	    Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37	    respectively in OpenWindows 3.  Applications must be recompiled, or you	    might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to	    change your keyboard layout back again.		@ When I type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit, I get the Sunview version	    See under "Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages" below.		    (see also next item)		@ Mixing X11 and OpenWindows	    (see also next item)		    Note that OpenWindows 3.0 includes the X11R4 core distribution (to patch	    level 18), but not the contrib directory.  These notes apply to	    OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with	    OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5.		    Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.	You can intermix OpenWindows	    and X11R4 or X11R5, they're all compatible in this respect.	    Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11.		    Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions	    of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a	    matter of preference.  In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory	    first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have	    /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in	    your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you'll get SunView programs instead	    of OpenWindows ones!		    Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11	    library directory.	This doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with	    older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't	    do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although	    xdm core dumps if this isn't right.		    Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't	    /usr/openwin.		    See Also:		Environment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH).		@ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found	    set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin.  If you also use X11, use		     /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib	    If you put this in a shell script or your .profile, use	    ${OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for	    /bin/sh; for csh it is different.		@ I launch my filemgr and I get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero	    Your system needs to be patched.  Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches	    and install the patch.		@ Why doesn't AnswerBook run for me?	    You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook.	It won't run under	    X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw	    the PostScript text and pictures.	    If you are using OpenWindows 3.0, you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0	    compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM.	    If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0, you can replace	    navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to	    satisfy your sense of paranoia!)	    The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2.	    Note that the data files are in PostScript, so you can look at them with	    a PostSript viewer (q.v.).		@ Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb?	    A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from	    ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z		@ Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu?	    It isn't implemented yet.  Many programs do respond to the Properties	    Key (L3), though, or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it.		@ File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool	    Sadly true, but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine.  It also	    works if you run command tool on a remote machine.	    Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2.		@ When I run OLIT programs, some of the widgets are red!	    Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation; action widgets can be	    selected via the keyboard.  The currently selected item is highlighted	    in red (the `Red Stain') to show that it has the input focus.	    To disable it in most places, add this to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file:		*traversalOn: off		*TextEdit.traversalOn: on		*TextField.traversalOn: on	    You can change the color using (for example)		*InputFocusColor: grey50		*input*FocusColor: green		*List*inputFocusColor: <your background color>	    See the man page resources(3w), at the start of the OLIT 3 Widget Set	    Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows 3 programmer documentation.	    Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30, the	    OLIT/3.0 CTE Jumbo Patch.		@ When I run several programs, the colors on the screen all change when	  I move into a different window! ("colormap flashing")	    	    This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time.	    However, you can minimise the effect with the following procedure:	    *  Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve.	    *  Run		cmap_compact save	       to create the .owcolors file	    *  Put the line		cmap_compact init	       near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc)	    *  Exit and then restart the window system.	    *  cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of		the colormap and reserves them.		    Also note that control-L2 locks the colors of the current window, and	    Control-L4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page.		@ pageiew uses the wrong colors, or makes the colormap flash (see above):	    This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif	    window manager (mwm) with OpenWindows.	    Try running pageview like this:		$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -svmono		$OPENWINHOME/bin/pageview		$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -discard		@ XDM breaks things	    Command tool doesn't like being run without a Unix `controlling terminal'.	    Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well.	    SunView applications may need to be run with svenv, as in		svenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic	    because xdm won't set the necessary environment variables.	    Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root, which is a security	    hole for OpenWindows; use the OpenWindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your	    users can access files and start Unix processes ass root...		@ Function keys 11 and 12 stopped working	    In OpenWindows 3.0, the X11 names ("keysyms") for these keys was changed	    to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37.	 Code which uses them should be recompiled,	    or you might be able to get away with		xmodmap -e 'keysym SunXK_F36 = SunF36'		    This section is here only until an XView FAQ appears, which has been	    promised, but hasn't reached here.	Note that there is also a usenet	    newsgroup, alt.toolkits.xview, although it doesn't sem to have very	    wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles	    per month.	You should also look at the FAQ in comp.windows.x.		@ how do I set the font of individual Scrolling List items?	    PANEL_LIST_FONT takes an int row_number and an Xv_opaque font_handle.	    PANEL_LIST_FONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xv_opaque font_handles.	    There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font.	    You have to make sure that you always specify PANEL_LIST_FONT when you	    insert a new row into that list, or write a convenience function	    insert_row(list, row, string) that hides the nasty bits.		@ how do I keep an XView pop-up window displayed after a button is pressed?	    In the button callback, do	        xv_set(button, PANEL_NOTIFY_STATUS, XV_ERROR, NULL);	    This will keep the window visible.	    You might also need to investigate the MENU_NOTIFY_STATUS attribute.		@ how do I make an XView button look pressed?	    call panel_begin_preview() and panel_cancel_preview(); these are	    documented in -- er -- the XView 3 source...		@ OpenWindows 3 imake doesn't work properly	    Here is Greg Earle's patch, to be applied in $OPENWINHOME; note that you	    should edit lib/config/sun.cf afterwards to get OSName and	    OSMinorVersion right (MinorVersion is 1 in SunOS 4.1.2, for example).

MoOLIT can be bought from AT&T in source form.		    OpenWindows can be obtained from Sun, or you can get the source from	    Interactive Systems Inc.  It is also included in some vendors' System V	    Release 4 implementations, although that's not always the latest version.	    The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures	    is 3.0; for the Sun 3 series it is frozen at OpenWindows 2.0.	    Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS, and it is also included as	    the windowing system for Solaris.		    There are said (by Sun) to be over 35 ports of OpenWindows either	    available now or in progress.  Unfortunately, none of them seem to	    be available from anywhere.

The most useful for OPEN LOOK users are:		Volume 1: XLib Programming Manual		Volume 2: XLib Reference Manual		Volume 3: X Window System User's Guide		    (An OPEN LOOK edition of Volume 3 should appear later this year)		Volume 7: XView Programmer's Manual [Dan Heller]		    [make sure you get the 3rd edition for XView 3.0]		Companion to Volume 7: XView Reference Manual [Ed. Thomas Van Raalte]			The Companion to Volume 7 is an expanded version of the Attribute		Summary from the previous edition of the XView Programming Manual,		together with other reference information, so that in practice you		have to buy both books.			O'Reilly also have a thinnish orange book on the differences between		X11R4 and RX115.			OLIT programmers will also want the Xt books - volumes 4 and 5.		There is a new big fat green Vol 5 updated for X11R5.			A journal, The X Resource, may also be of interest.

PostScript Language Tutorial and Cookbook,		Adobe Systems Inc., Addison Wesley, 1985 ["The blue book"]	    	    There's at least one book on using Solaris (i.e. SunOS).		    Sun also supplies a large amount of documentation with OpenWindows,	    although you may have to order it separately.  Here's what I have; they	    are each a little over 21 cm square (wider than A4 paper), and vary from	    about 1 cm to about 3cm thick.  They say `User's Guide' or `Programmer's	    Guide' on the front.

Very easy to use.		    there _might_ be an OLIT port of this UI builder.		    one of the first third-party GUI builders to support OPEN LOOK,	    using the XView toolkit.  It was reviewed in SunExpert magazine	    in 1990.		    uib is a user interface builder which supports building applications	    that support both OPEN LOOK and Motif.	It generates code for	    ParcPlace's OI C++ toolkit and can make use of user created	    subclasses.  Note: `OI' can also display an OSF/Motif GUI at runtime.		    Uses X resources to specify an Xt widget hierarchy and actions to	    user-defined callbacks.  uses OLIT, Xt or Motif.		    Lets you write code to a common subset of OPEN LOOK, Motif, Microsoft	    Windows, the Macintosh GUI, and even terminals (using curses).  You buy	    an XVT toolkit for each environment.				    XView-based program that plots Lorenz Attractors and other chaotic things	    in real time.  Also includes a mathematical expression interpreter.	    ftp: macomb.tn.cornell.edu		    Handles x-y scatterplots, lineplots, bargraphs, FFT analysis, running	    averages, polynomial fits, etc.		Description:	    Graph plotting in various styles & axes; Data manipulation - arithmetic,	    functions, smoothing, folding, sorting; Fitting to data using Gaussians,	    polynomials, Lorentzians, and/or user defined functions; Annotation of	    graphs; log files;  Commands with loops etc.; Colour; PostScript output.	Requirements:	    Robot is XView based. User interface portions of code are written in	    'C'. Data manipulation code is written in FORTRAN. Hence a FORTRAN	    compiler is also required or the public domain f2c package.	    Alternatively, a SPARC binary is available by anonymous ftp.			Description:	    An OPEN LOOK UI to the Casio BOSS scheduler		Description:	    This is the OpenWindows properties editor, that appears when you choose	    the Properties... item from the WorkSpace menu.

Notes:	    Conferencing software that lets multiple connected users share the same	    drawing screen, with bitmap capture and moveable pointer.	Requirements:	    You can only run one ShowMe per computer, so you have to have a CPU per	    conference member.			     	Description:	    name_finder was orginally designed as a replacement for the name finder	    missing from the OpenWindows Version 3.0 mailtool.  It has since grown	    into a tool for several electronic mail related activities including:	    interaction with local ListServ robots for handling mail lists,	    requesting Full.Name style mail aliases from your local PostMaster, and	    providing mailbox status information ala finger(1).		    name_finder is written in C++ (cfront 2.1) using gxv++ version 1.1.	    If you don't have access to a C++ compiler, a precompiled sparc	    executable is included in the distribution.		Description:	    GUI for mantaining bibliography databases which can be used with	    LaTeX, TeX and FrameMaker			Notes:	    formerly called xftp.	    compiles under (at least) Ultrix, AIX 3.1.5, AIX 3.2, Convex OS, SunOS,	    Unicos 6.1.4, and IRIX.  Uses OLIT.	    BUG: can also use OSF/Motif and Athena widgets.			Description:	    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the	    `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the	    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.	 You can	    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This	    lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around	    from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm.

It's *not* enough to be runing an OPEN LOOK UI [tm] window manager such	    as olwm.		Notes:	    Only runs under OpenWindows 2.			simple interface to NeWS and the OpenWindows server		Notes:	    Crispin Goswell's PostScript interpreter, much hacked.	    Not OPEN LOOK compliant.  No Type 1 font support.	    There are other versions of this called `xps', `postscript', etc.;	    don't confuse this `xps' with the one mentioned above.

Notes:	    A version of Xterm with an OPEN LOOK UI, print interface,	    ANSI X3.64 colour escape sequences, etc.		Other Products: IsoTeX, IsoFax, Power Base	Notes:	    An OLIT-based terminal emulator.  I couldn't get the demo version to	    give me a shell prompt, although it did look like it was a pretty fll	    vt340 emulation, with double-height characters, colour, fonts, grahics	    and so forth.	    With the Union Flag (the British flag) as their logo I somehow expected	    an English address, perhaps in Bristol...			    Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide,	    which lists over 200 pages of applications.		    You can also get the free CDWare CD/ROM, which contains demo versions	    of several popular OPEN LOOK UI applications.

Ada bindings for XView	    Sun Ada 1.1 includes among other things an Ada Source Code Generator	    for Devguide.  It uses the Verdix XView Ada bindings.	    It does not yet [July 1992] support gfm (the guide file manager).		C++ Bindings for XView		Qualix's XV++.		UIT				    Sun: SPARC, SunOS 4.1	    Sun: SPARC, Solaris 2 (actually 3.0.1?)	    others: none so far...		There are said (by Sun) to be two or three ports of OpenWindows either	available now or in progress.  Contact Anthony Flynn at Open Vistas	International (anthony@ovi.com) for more information.  (originally they	said 35, but perhaps they meant 3.5)		OpenWindows source is available - commercially, it costs about $5,000 for	the server, including TypeScaler and the toolkits; deskset (filemgr etc) is	another $25,000; ToolTalk is $40,000 or so.				Notes:	    The libraries and utilities (olwm, cmdtool, etc) are available for	    anonymous ftp from encyclo.jax.org. I used gcc 2.1 to compile the	    sources. If there is enough interest, I can make the diffs	    available.			Notes:	    Let me stress that this is *not* fully tested, but seems to work	    pretty well.  Please let me know about any problems you find.	    Problems I already know about:		Large buttons under *any* non-Sun X server (non-xnews; i.e. any		standard MIT X11R[45] server) have the bottom of the button		chopped off.  We're working on this one. :-)	    XView 3 is also available on the DEC Freeware CD, from DECUS.	[actually this seems *not* to be Dave Scott's port; please accept my apologies	 for listing this incorrectly.  A correct entry will appear as soon as I get	 the necessary information.  -- Lee]		Notes:	    Includes HP 720 build, HP XView patch file, Xvgr.				Notes:	    His patches were for Esix 4.0.3 but should work on DELL, ISC and Intel	    SVR4 with no worries. The files are README.xview3 and xview3.diff.Z.	See Also: linux		Notes:	    There is still a problem with tty support for the RS/6000. For	    instance, the cmdtool will not work. Still, most everything else works.	    For those of you who have already installed my previous patch, I have	    put a separate patch for just the shared library problem. This file is	    contrib/xview3/Fixes/xview3_rs6k_XView_lib.patch.Z.		Notes:	    Inlcudes olvwm, UIT		Notes:					In general, there is no point in using XView 2 if you have XView 3 available;	it's a good idea to look for an XView 3 port first.  Moving from XView 2 to	XView 3 is usually simply a matter of recompiling, unless you've done	"dirty tricks" or used undocumented calls.

These	  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the	  performance of your workstation.		  Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more	  hardware is always even a necessity.		  This "FAQ" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different	  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X	  Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.		  Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must	  balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal	  decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many	  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.		  This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course	  many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.	  However, they are outside the scope of this document.		    [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system	    performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook	    "System Performance Tuning" by Mike Loukides.  IMHO, it contains a	    well-written, comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm	    unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.]		-----------------	Table of Contents	-----------------	  0.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few	  months old (see the "Last-modified" date above) you should probably	  locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.		  If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does	  not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can	  retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.		  There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about	  them and how to access them, please see the "Introduction to the	  news.answers newsgroup" posting in news.answers.		  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document	  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If	  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by	  sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the	  command "send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups" in the message body.		-----------------------------	What about the "Other X FAQ"?	-----------------------------		  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and	  well written "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" document.	  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates	  on performance.		  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with	  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:		"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4".	  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).		---------------	Window Managers	---------------		  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different	  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a	  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this	  point, most respondents have agreed upon "twm" as the best candidate	  for a speedy window manager. 		  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,	  is turning off unnecessary things like "zooming" and "opaque move".	  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the	  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping	  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)		  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:	  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is	  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)	  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the	  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.		------------	The X Server	------------		Which Server?	- - - - - - -	  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.	  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.		  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between	  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to	  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute	  to less paging.  	         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),	                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]		  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law	  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be	  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.	  You can expect to get "*very* large speedups in the server" by not	  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results	  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial	  compilers on the market.		Locking the Server into RAM?	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -	  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and	  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help	  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few	  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone	  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  				  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),					      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),					      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]	Starting your Server	- - - - - - - - - - -	  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :	    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep	    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my	    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...	    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.		  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  		  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of	  why this works, which I have summarized here:		    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to	    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by	    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of	    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the	    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you	    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself	    sorted out before the clients start up.		    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X	    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources	    being fetched, programs initializing state and "databases" and so	    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this	    initialization is done ("The process has reached a steady state"),	    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.	    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your	    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your	    workstation's limited resources		  This is most definitely a "Your Mileage May Vary" situation, as there	  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap	  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients	  you are starting, etc.		  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:		(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &		(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &		(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &		(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &		  I've experimented with:		(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &		(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &		(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &		(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &		  I've even tried:		(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &	  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:		(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &		(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &		(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &		(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &		    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had	    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down	    into a "steady state" before the sleep expired and all my clients	    were launched. ]		  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with	  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to	  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.		Fonts	- - -	  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts	  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.		  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one	  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or	  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.	  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded	  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer	  fonts will be loaded by the server.				      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),				        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]		  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13	  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since	  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.		  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):	    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.	    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.		About the Resources File	- - - - - - - - - - - - -		    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves	    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)		  One suggestion:		    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum	    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your	    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true		    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific	    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your	    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:			setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N		    [ The "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" FAQ contains	    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.	    --ed.]		    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from	    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,	    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same	    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system	    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to	    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files	    with the same name.		    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).			    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),			         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),			             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).		     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]		  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following	  benefits:		    - Easier to maintain / more usable.		    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER	      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally	      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.		    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort 	      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.		  It also has drawbacks:		    - the application that you are interested in has to load an	      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to	      make that much of a performance difference, and you might	      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an	      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the	      application without having to "xrdb" again.		    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When	      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and	      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.	      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!		      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped	      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource	      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why	      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*	      provide any error message when it encountered the C style	      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted	      processing the resource file.		      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef	      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this	      method of resource management.		    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For	      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their	      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.		    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files	      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client	      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the	      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find	      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)		  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)	  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my	  .Xdefaults file, and to use the "separate resources files" method for	  clients that I seldom use.		Define Your Display Properly	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -		  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In	  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to 	  "<hostname>:0.0", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you	  should set your DISPLAY variable to "unix:0.0" or ":0.0".  By doing this	  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same	  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.				[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]		  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further	  explanation of how to properly set your display name.		  "I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have	  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when	  the DISPLAY isn't set specially."				      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)		  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change	  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.	  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle	  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT	  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if	  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]		-------	Clients	-------		  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think	  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also	  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there	  a smaller clock program than xclock?		  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large	  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.		  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients	  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]		  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject	  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are	  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather	  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using	  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In	  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually	  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.		  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try	  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif	  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in	  more than one toolkit library.		  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client	  programs would work best together in that environment.

I suspect that	  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.	  Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.		  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines	  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),			   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]		1) Xvt	   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :	   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z		   "...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get	   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as	   xterm is rather a hog! "		   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to	   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current	   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that	   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any	   yet.		   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with	   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He	   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For	   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling	   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap	   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm	   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard	   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text	   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.		   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it	   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets	   brought into memory.		   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of	   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.	   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.

Tuning your client	- - - - - - - - - -		  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.		  From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif	  Text Field Widgets:		    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I	    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,	    particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was	    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource	    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget	    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.	    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the	    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user	    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not	    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference	    on a [slower system].		  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots	  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor	  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server	  requests?		-------------------------	Miscellaneous Suggestions	-------------------------		Pretty Pictures	- - - - - - - -	  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.		  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server	    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)		  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm	    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see	    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.		    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by	    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.		  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate	    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.				      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) 				for reminding me of this one. --ed.]		A Quicker Mouse	- - - - - - - -	  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen	  when you move your mouse.  I use "xset m 3 10" in my .xinitrc file,	  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of	  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.		  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for	  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different	  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  		  e.g. (for twm) :	      menu "mouse settings" {	        "Mouse Settings:"			f.title		"  Very Fast"				! "xset m 7 10 &"		"  Normal (Fast)"			! "xset m 3 10 &"		"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)"	! "xset m default &"		"  Glacial"				! "xset m 0 10 &"	      }		Programming Thoughts	- - - - - - - - - - -	  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :	    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of	    things you can do.  Some that stick out:		    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual	      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or	      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager	      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.		    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.		    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.	      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)		    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE	      difference.		    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the	      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable	      one.		  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :	    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc	    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based	    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying	    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some	    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the	    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)		  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]		  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :		  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.		    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but	    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the	    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most	    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to	    run through it's event-loop again and again.		  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.		    This "Gfx Context Switching" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,	    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed	    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching	    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will	    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the	    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).		Say What!?	- - - - - - 	  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:		  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :	    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs	    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your	    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the	    same operation between client and server.		  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received	  the following confirmation...		  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):	    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big	    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage	    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This	    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was	    essential when I only had 8 MB.		  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :	    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as	    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a	    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in	    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.		  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :	    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's	    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate	    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they	    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your	    action.		    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2	    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going	    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved	    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing	    even fewer context switches.		----------------------------	Other Sources of Information	----------------------------		  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System	  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.		  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):	    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper "Improving X	    Application Performance" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in	    Issue 3 of The X Resource.		    An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992	    conference proceedings.

	Im new to Xlib programming. Im having a problem I hope someone here can	help me with. I create a window, and I want it to have some background color,	say red, and draw an oval in it. Further, when I resize the window, I want	to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it	is larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000.		My problem is this: when I resize the window, only the "original" part of the	window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything else	is a grey..the oval "tries" to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see that	it WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it, but it only shows up in	the region that was the original size of the window when created.		For example, I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If I	resize it to 400x400, the only part that has any color drawn into it is	is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the oval	only shows up in that 200x200 area.		What am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a 	re-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window?		Second question:	Could someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are???		Thanks,	Chris

			Hi, friends,		Our SPARC workstation is now equippied with a GT-accelerator. we want to use	it to display stereo images. The accelerator has double buffers. How can we	access the buffers and switch between them ? With which functions can we do 	that ? with functions from XGL, Phigs, Xlib or Xlib-extension ?		Your help will be highly appreciated.

		X/Motif Gurus,			How do you handling scaling of X text while performing zooming 	operations  on figures? Is restricting user to select scalable fonts too 	restrictive and  a absolute NO NO?	Any books that have discussion on this topic?  Should have really taken more 	of those Computer Graphics courses but, now its too late -:( )			I will summarize response.	Thanks in advance.		-Subodh ( smn@netcom.com )

	Well, thanks largely to subscribers of this group, here's xrastool 1.0,	the animation package I started just over 3 weeks ago. A number of the	solutions provided through discussions here have been incorporated in	the code, so have a look! The full blurb has been posted to	comp.windows.x.announce.		This post is in two parts. To unpack the source code, extract the	articles into file1 and file2 (for example). Use a text editor to	remove leading and trailing text at the "---cut here---" markers	(including the markers themselves). Next type "cat file1 file2 >	file", then "uudecode file" and "zcat xrastool1.0.tar.Z | tar xvf -".	Read the README file for instructions on how to proceed from there.	Enjoy!		Derek		P.S. The source is also available for anon ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu	in the contrib/ directory. If there is enough demand, a static binary	will be provided for those without the XView libraries or include	files.		-----------------------------------------------------------	| Derek C.

		Hello everybody out there !		I'm trying to compile X11R5pl23 and Motif 1.2.1 on a HP running	HP-UX 8.05. But it' seems to be not very succesful, because 	I have only hp.cf config-files for HP-UX 7.0. 		I tried standard cc and X was compiled with a lot of warnings.	The motif applications are compiled quite well, but they won't run.	I receive the XKeysymDB error which is reported in FAQ, but	I cannot fix it. The XKeysymDB-file is at the right location and it	works fine under SunOS.	Probably I have started the compilation Prozess only with a wrong	config-file.		Please help me !	  	Thanx in advance 	  Markus		-----------------------------------------------------------------	 Markus Koch                           Universitaet-GH Paderborn 	 Email : raistlin@uni-paderborn.de     Rechnerbetreuung	 Phone : +49 5251 60 3322              Warburger Str. 100	         +49 5251 60 3318              W4790 Paderborn, Germany	----------------------------------------------------------------- 	--		-----------------------------------------------------------------	 Markus Koch                           Universitaet-GH Paderborn 	 Email : raistlin@uni-paderborn.de     Warburger Str. 100	 Phone : +49 5251 60 3322              W4790 Paderborn, Germany	-----------------------------------------------------------------

	Some  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need, and	it seems that someone out there just might have done it  already,  and	can point me to some tools that would help. What they'd like to do is:	Given a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the	data  is  arriving  over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slow	link), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the	picture,  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus, the picture	might first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each  4x4  square  of	pixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next, each 4x4 square	would be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be	painted.		Since  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side	of a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmitted	as  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead, there would have to	be a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a	small  bitmap,  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the	magnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X	server  can help.  That is, when a window is opened, is there a way to	ask that a "filter" program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the	only  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process	("Permission denied" ;-), and have it open a local window?		It seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up	such  a  program  remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each	one by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to  expand.	But  if  there is something that X itself can do to help, it's be nice	to hear about it.  (I looked in several FMs,  but  if  it's  there,  I	obviously  don't  know  the keywords ;-).  If someone has a nifty tool	available that packages it all, we might want to get a copy.		Oh, yes; this is to run on some Suns.  Part of the idea  is  to  build	demos  that  can  show such things as "If this were run across, say, a	4800-bps link, this is how fast the pictures would appear."  Then  the	customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for.		-- 	If the auto industry were like the computer industry, a car would  now	cost $5, would get 5000 miles to the gallon, and at random times would	explode, killing all its passengers.

Ghostview is a postscript previewer	that uses ghostscript.		From the ghostview README:				    Ghostview -- An X11 user interface for ghostscript.		Ghostview is full function user interface for ghostscript 2.4.		Brief list of features:	  - Ghostview parses any known version of Adobe's Document Structuring	    Conventions.	  - Page size is automatically determined from the Document Structuring	    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.	  - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures.	  - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or	    application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our	    European friends.	  - Scrollbars appear when necessary.	  - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring	    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.	  - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Upside-down,	    and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction).	  - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale 	    or color on a Color monitor.)	  - Ability to mark pages for printing, or saving.  (Good for people that	    printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.)	  - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution	    (1 display dot = 1 printer dot).		    The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people	    are encouraged to use in other programs.		    Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from:	        prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z	        appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z			From the ghostscript README:		*****************************************************	* This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. *	*****************************************************		********	******** An overview of Ghostscript ********	********		Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:		        - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language, which very	closely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and		        - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that	implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive	operations in the Ghostscript language.		The Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely	in C, with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms.	Currently, Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform	families:		        - IBM PC and compatibles with EGA, VGA, SuperVGA, or compatible	          graphics under MS-DOS 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0;		        - A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11,	          release 3, 4, and 5, including Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i,	          Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix;	          H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX	          running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2;	          Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo;		        - Sun workstations (Sun-3, SPARC, Sun-386i) running SunView;		        - VAX, VMS with X11R3/4/5, gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler	          version 3.1 or later is required).

May I humbly suggest DESQview/X? (Of course, I'm biased...)		DESQview/X is a multitasker for DOS computers, that uses a standard	X11R4 server as it's display mechanism. DOS applications and Microsoft	Windows standard mode are converted on-the-fly to X-protocol, allowing	you to display them, or any R4 compatable X-program from any machine	on the net to display to the PC's local display (or to any other display	on the net).		Free tools are available for devloping X-applications for the DVX platform;	many X-programs have been ported between DVX and UNIX with little or	no modifications. (Often, you only need to create a new makefile!)

If you already own all the "clone" equipment then there are lots of such	programs (see a current copy of Unix World Magazine).		*BUT*  your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone.	(From experience).  You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this	is a new install.  The performance will be at least four times better.	In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use.  On top of that	they will cost about the same (price a clone with 4MB RAM, ethernet card,	very high performance graphics card, GOOD monitor, server software, TCP/IP	for clone software, mouse, keyboard, etc, etc, etc.... you spend a whole	lot of $$$$).		I can get 15" Tektronix XP11 terminals for under $900, and the performance	is over 80000 Xstones.....	-- 	  /--------------------------------------------------------------------------\	  | Mark A.

	I've spent the past week tearing my hair out, trying to get the output of	a piped "tail -f" to end up in a widget.  I've managed to make it work in	some ugly ways, but either a) X blocks on the tail and won't allow user	input, b) the "tail -f" functions like just "tail" and doesn't follow the	expansion of the file, c) the "tail -f" doesn't die after I've closed	the pipe and destoryed the widget, or d) pclose() blocks forever waiting	for tail to die.		I _know_ this code has to exist.  Anybody have it?  A general	popen() case would be perfered but at this point I'll take anything...

Is there anything on the public domain or shareware ?		  And in the commercial area is there anything with aggressive	 pricing ?		  What about incompatibilities ? Window managers ?		  Any info is welcome.				  Thanx in advance.			  C U!	 	  By(e)	 	    Mario Valente

Try to get axe - It's a wonderful X based editor and much simpler to use than	emacs what is a overkill.

(I'm currently writing one... but it's in very early stage)	3) xdtm may be a medium good replacement.	4) X associates icons with nothing. A number of X Window Managers associate	   icons with windows, in a way to ease window management.	   But this has nothing to do with icons of a Desktop Manager application.	5) The tool bitmap is there for simple icon drawing.		|> 3) I've noticed some people have somehow discovered a way to display .GIF	|>    (or some kind of picture files) in the background, either replacing or	|>    overlapping some the usual grey background employed by Xwindows.

		I've written an application for SparcStation 2 GX+, under OpenWindows 3.0.		The application uses XView stuff to create my window, and the SUN XGL	graphics library for rendering into the Canvas.		The application does real-time 2-D animation, but it does not update the	the display fast enough.	I'm using notify_set_itimer (XView call) to periodically kick off my	update routine, and it's not happening fast enough. I want it to	update 25 times / second. It's only doing about 11. Also, it appears to	be compute bound, because if I run anything else while my appplication is	up, the update rate slows down even more.		Any ideas ?	Thanks.	
		  I'm running HP-UX 8.07 with HP VUE 2.01 and I need a hardcopy of	  the login window (the one asking  for login and password) to 	  include in a manual. 	  I have tried:	   xwd -display hostname:0 -root -out login.xwd 		  from a login on a remote terminal, but it doesn't work. 	  Xwd seems to wait for the window server, but the window	  server doesn't answer. 		  Any suggestions? I must use xwd because I don't have access to	  ftp and I can't obtain another program to grab the screen.

	  How can I draw an object of a specified color over objects of varying colors	  and then erase it without having to redraw everything else?		  What's happening is this,		      If I draw it using GXcopy, it is drawn in the specified color.  If I erase	      it using GXcopy with foreground and background reversed, it erases 	      whatever it overlayed.  I then need to redraw	      all of the items it crossed.  Yuch.		      If I draw it using GXinvert it is drawn in a random color - nothing 	      resembling what I requested.  It properly restores the color of 	      underlying objects in erase mode.

The problems are:	- Using the "xv_window_loop" functions most XView objects dont work	  (as the List Item), and the timers aren't called.	 	- With the "notify_dispatch" explicit I have problem because:	  "...never attempt to do direct dispaching from within a callback	  routine..." as say the "XView Programming Manual (Third Edition)"	  on page 486 (uhm... I know this number!!! :->).	  But I need to do dispatching just inside a callback routine!	 	Help me, please!!!	 	Thanks in advance,	--- Giovanni	 	P.S.

	I am planning to convert my Motif 1.2 app from pixel to font units	which would all be set in the app's resource file instead of hard coded	in the program.		However, the word here is from people who tried this already that for	some unknown reason XmForm offsets placed in the resource file are still	interpreted in pixel units forcing people to code those offset font units into the program.		Can somebody confirm this?		Thanks,	Joe Pannon	pannon@bcsfse.ca.boeing.com

	Hi folks,		I'm trying to compile xfig 2.1.7 on a SS1+ running SunOS 4.1.1 and OW 2.0,	and I'm having a little trouble with make/imake.  Specifically, make bombs	when it needs to use any Xaw file.  This isn't surprising since X11 files	on Suns with the standard OW 2.0 distribution are in various places under	/usr/openwin (Xaw files are in /usr/openwin/share/include/X11/Xaw !!)	Actually, the real problem is that I know squat about imake, and I don't	know how to tell imake where the X11 files are.  I can see from the 	Makefile that it's looking in the wrong places, but the first line of the 	Makefile reads 		   # Makefile generated by imake - do not edit!		Help!  Is there some way I can edit the Imakefile to tell it where to	look?  (I have set DEFINES = -DOPENWIN_BUG, as it said to in the README	file.)		Email and post are both fine.		Thanks in advance,		Dave

	Xm++/CommonInteract    Another User Interface Development System	-------------------		If you would like to implement X-Toolkit applications with C++ in a style	like this...		// mini sample application /////////////////////////////////////		class Test : public XmWindow {		void cmd(char*);		void quit(void*);	public:	    Test() : XmWindow("Xm++ Test Window") {}			void initialize();	};		void Test::initialize() {	    XmDropdownMenu* menu = createDropdownMenu();		    menu->addLabel("&File");	    menu->addItems( Entry("Menu Item &One", CB(Test::cmd)), 	                    Entry("Menu Item &Two", CB(Test::cmd)),	                    NULLENTRY);	    menu->addSeparator();	    menu->addItem(	Entry("E&xit", CB(Test::quit)));		    addSubpane(Edit, "myEdit");	    edit("myEdit")->setText("Hello World.");	}		void Test::cmd(char* n) {		edit("myEdit")->setText(n);	}		void Test::quit(void*) {		exit(0);	}		void XmApp::initialize() {	    (new Test)->initialize();	}		///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////		...then continue reading (contents of the current release's README):		Xm++ is a user interface framework for the C++ language built upon X11	and the X-Toolkit. It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming	interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets.	Xm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set, now support for the	Athena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both	environments without changes, although many nice features are only	available when using Motif.	In some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing	a ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows), but never tries to replace it -	data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated	in rare cases.		Xm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to	encapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many	ideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version,	which provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications	(in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and	a simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-).		Top level objects in Xm++:	* 'Windows', 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout	  feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw	* 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface	  builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this	  distribution)		Controls (children of top level objects):	'staticText', 'staticImage', 'pushButton', 'checkBox', 'radioButton',	'edit', 'listBox', 'comboBox', 'groupBox', 'paneArea', 'drawing', 'toolBar'		The staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap	format) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text.		Event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects	Xt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects.			CommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides	components for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very	simplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system	(research project of our institute in 1991), an approach to define a	software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications	with multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices).	If you are interrested, look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS	Publications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be	our paper about CommonInteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state of	the art' from 1991).	CommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was	used to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing	primitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it to	support bitmaps and some controls also.	Known problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always	redraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting an	object), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed.			About this first release:		Xm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here	for smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think	I can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications	for any non-critical purposes.	CommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will	be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research	project here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems	to be stable and can be used for experimental applications.

We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned.	You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver-	tical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking,	set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enough	advertising.		I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories	I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do	what we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since	xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to	X10).		The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you	provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the	cursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused.	Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you 	do anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just	have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after	it's mapped.		As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export	is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new	release for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work.	But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say	whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version.		As is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else 	than a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line	of code). I'll put this on export today.

'ps' told me that there's a X-server and a xterm running. And with some 	experimenting with the mouse and repeatedly pressing ^D I blindly hit the	xterm, endet the session and got my prompt back.

	Extract from the color README file for Anthony's Icon Library.	For Network discussion...		Color Coordination...		    I tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the	  year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow	  (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no	  one responded at all.		    The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly	  you will soon find that the workstations color table, devotes itself	  solely the window manager, icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead	  of applications that actually require the colors for proper working.	  ``Color needful applications'' such as :  Picture and graphic displayers,	  Animation, Real Time video, Raytracers, etc... .		    The following is a suggested color table for icons, and general use.	  Icons, Window Managers, and general applications, should follow this	  table or something like it, UNLESS the application is ``color needful''.		     * for each primary color (red,green,blue) three colors	             EG: values   0, 128 and 255.	       This results in  3 ^ 3  colors (27) representing most of the	       standard colors for use in icons.		     * two extra shades of grey	             EG: vales    (black) 0, 64, 128, 196 and 255 (white,red,...)		     * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading	       a and 3-D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager.		    This table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of	  posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the	  workstation.

Methods to automatically passwd Authorization from one machine to another.	  This also includes the problem of notifing the remote host of the current	DISPLAY that is being used.		1/ Use rsh/rexec/on...  (the method in the xauth manual)	      Set up the your .rhosts file in the home directory on the remote	  machine so that a password in not required to remotly execute commands.		         xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh other xauth merge -		  This method is also used by xrsh to pass authorization. My vampire	  program also uses a variation, however I wrap it as part of the remote	  command sequence  (EG:  xauth add $auth)		     Included in this method is the use of `xrlogin' and `xrsh' to do	  this job for you. These programs usally (the newer ones that is) allow	  you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes	  the `DISPLAY' and/or a copy of the authorization code required.		     The `xon' program available (if enabled) on sun machines will also	  pass environment variables, as well as the current directory.  You will	  however be required to store the Authority in such a variable for	  passing. Unless you are also have shared home directories.		    WARNING: Environment variables and command line arguments are visible	  in `ps' listing with the appropiate flags. As such passing authorization	  information in environment variables or as arguments is not recomended.	  The recommended method as given in the manual (shown above) is safe from	  the view of other users.		2/ Wrap it as part of the TERM environment variable.	      This method uses the fact that most remote command executors do pass	  the TERM environment variable to the remote host. It is then a matter of	  an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information	  from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly.	    A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does	  this. Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the	  actual call to rlogin is performed, to include your DISPLAY and your	  authorization.	    On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the	  TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or	  stty'ing your terminal.		  ---8<---	  script for launching rlogin:	    #!/bin/sh	    # ~/bin/rl   --- Rlogin with display:	    if [ -n "$DISPLAY" ]; then	      case "$DISPLAY" in	        :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;;	      esac	      TERM="$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY`"	      export TERM	    fi	    rlogin $*	  ---8<---	  add to your .cshrc or .login	    if ( $?TERM ) then	      if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd '&'` != '' ) then	        echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f3 | xauth nmerge -	        setenv DISPLAY `echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f2`	        setenv TERM    `echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f1`	      endif	    endif	  ---8<---	  xterm command to use	    xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname	  ---8<---		3/ NFS.	     Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to.	   Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted, then authorization	   is automatically passed, Hoever you will still have to pass your	   DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means. IE:		      login host:       echo $DISPLAY > ~/.X11host	      remote host:      setenv DISPLAY `cat ~/.X11host`		4/ Finger for the info in a .plan file	      This involves encrypting the information into your `.plan' or	  `.project' and having the remote machine finger for the information.	  This has the disadvantage of having the information to anyone fingering	  the user.  Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each	  individual.  IE: the method of decyrption must not be shared or known	  by others, nor should it be easy to determine.	    A improvment is to use the `who fingered me' technique to only give	  the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone	  who is asking.	    This last method was developed last year by a second year here, untill	  I explained to him the need for the encryption, at which point he gave	  up this method. It is however a valid method. It is easer than (2) but	  less secure.

	This is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking:				I am attempting to add a working SaveScreen function to a new	server.  I have been able to get the screen to blank out properly, and through	debugging I can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0,	which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen.		My problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1, even	after I have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys.  My question is:  what am	I likely to be missing that would cause this problem?  I copied the basic	design of my function from the existing versions:		static Bool next_savescreen(scr,on)	ScreenPtr scr;	Bool on;	{		  /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way? */	  if (on != SCREEN_SAVER_ON) {			nextSetLastEventTime();	  }		  if (on == SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { /* Save user's current setting */			next_save_screen_brightness = NXScreenBrightness(my_eventhandle);			NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, 0.0); /* Blank the screen */	  }	  else {											 /* Unblank the screen */			NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, next_save_screen_brightness);	  }		  return TRUE;	}		I can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the	saver, but I cannot find where it "wakes up" the server and unblanks the	screen.		Any tips/help would be appreciated.		Thanks.			-- 	Douglas Scott                              (805)893-8352	Center for Computer Music Research and Composition	University of California, Santa Barbara

I have tried that with one font, if your xterm terminfos/termcaps are set up	to NOT remap bold (which they are be default) to reverse, then nothing happens	when bold is displayed.

	I am using xnlock as the screensaver for a PC-based X server. However,	after an interval of no activity, my X session ends. This does not	happen when I use xscreensaver. 		My screensave command is fired up from my .xsession like this:		xautolock -time 1 -locker xnlock -corners ++++ -cornerdelay 1 &		My hypothesis is that xdm (I use xdmcp to start my X session) detects	a period of inactivity from the server, then terminates the session.	However, for some reason, this does not happen with xscreensaver. Is	there a workaround?		I'd prefer responses via e-mail.

	Hi,		I'm trying to get my program to monitor resize/position events,	so that when the program exits, I can save the last known geometry in 	some sort of 'preferences' file.		I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell:		 XtAddEventHandler(topLevel,StructureNotifyMask,False,configureCB,myData);		This works fine, and my callback is called whenever the window is resized	or repositioned using the window manager (mwm).		However, when I'm just resizing the window, using any resize handle on the	window manager resize decoration, the x and y are set to zero in the	XEvent passed to the event handler callback.  I'm accessing the xconfigure	structure, like the X11 manual says.  (xev->xconfigure.x, xev->xconfigure.y).	The width and height memebers are correct.		When I reposition the window, using the window manager, the xevent's xconfigure	structure contains all the correct x, y, width, height member settings.		Q1: Anybody know why, when just resizing, the x and y are being set to zero?		Q2: Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes?		I've tried using XtGetValues() on the topLevel widget when exiting my	application (before destroying any widgets) and all I get is garbage values	for the x, y, width, height resources.

The server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous, though (see also DESQview/X,	which does this in its DOS windows).

		After looking at the scaling code I realized the follwing:		  1) My problem with the resolution 100x100 foints is due to an installation 	     problem.		  2) That the X server or font server will rescale the best font it can find	     to meet your requirements.  		     This means that if you server return a response like the following		     -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso8859-1		     You can ask for the follwogin:		        -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--14-100-90-90-p-0-iso8859-1	 	     and it will generate it for you.

	Due it seems to Sun's crapulous organisation of the X libraries and includes,	most standard (GNU and other) software won't compile out of the box (well, tar	file).

		I understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets:		                       callbacks and actions		The problem I face now is that I have a quite long piece of application code	that performs a lot of drawing into a window. I want to connect this to a	widget. No problem so far. I could use a callback function or an action to do this, processing any events afterwards.		But because the drawing takes some while, I want the application code sequence	to be able to be interrupted by events. Then I want to handle the events	and resume with processing the application code at the point it was	interrupted.	It seems to me that this isn't possible, but how can I give the user the	impression that his inputs are immediately processed ?		Has anybody an idea?		Please answer via e-mail.		Thanks in advance.

Jordan implemented the system	dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for,	call it, operating system types, then you go ahead and write a include	file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic	implementations. Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a 	OS flavor yet, that is fully POSIX, we haven't gotten around to	really implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically	for just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file	tty_sun.i for example, but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all	it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and	every operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. The type	of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm	sources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a 	couple of times, this only uses up some disk space, since only the 	"drivers" actually included from the toplevel include file will be 	compiled into emu.		It shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully	relies on the posix stuff, but unfortunately I don't have a linux	system available to me, so I can't do the port myself. I would suggest	you read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or	questions, contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunately	we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu, since we 	just don't have access to that many different systems.

I've looked thru various faq files, also to no avail.	Is there one lurking about in some  archive?   Nothing  sophisticated;	just "show the pretty picture"?		Alternatively, if I could locate the specs for gif, I don't suppose it	would be too hard to write it myself, but I have no idea where to even	start looking for the spec.

	When I changed from SVR4 to SVR4.2 on my Intel box I discovered that	some of my SVR4 xclients such as xload, etc would no longer work.			They bomb out with the message:			Is this because they can't find the correct shared libraries, they need	to be recompiled, or have I not used the correct options?		Both systems use X11R5.		Thanks.

	Thanks to Bruce Barnett, who recommended xvttool, and Bernward Averwald and	Liam Quin, who recommended modifying .Xdefaults to get the desired behavior	for a *class* of xterms.		In xvttool, simply create a key file that looks like:	"a"	"A"	"b"	"B"	"c"	"C"	...	and specify said key file on the command line.  This will translate	any input into any other (in my case, lo-case to up-case).  Works great, and	you get a customizable button-pad on the right or left side.		To use an xterm solution, add to your .Xdefaults:	capxterm*VT100.Translations: #override \	   <Key>a: string("A")\n\	   ...		or:	capxterm.vt100.translations: #override \n\	        <Key>a: insert-string(A) \n\	        <Key>b: insert-string(B) \n\	        ...		and invoke as: xterm -name capxterm		Thanks loads!	-- 	Kevin Weinrich     Computer Sciences Corp.	kbw@helios.ath.epa.gov

What I'd like to see is this scenario: 		Each widget, view, whatever, describes it's colors via a palette. 	Palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information. 	They are not directly tied to the object that uses them.  Palettes are	held in the server.  A palette can accomadate, up to, the number of	hardware color cells of color descriptors. 		When the input focus is in a particular widget, that widget has access	to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette.  ALL	OTHER WIDGETS, TRANSIENTLY, GET THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION THAT CAN BE	GENERATED BY A UNION OF THE COLORS FROM THE CURRENT PALETTE AND ANY FREE	COLORS THAT ARE LEFT OVER. 		A widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index (pixel)	into its associated palette. 		The bold part above is hard and would need to be done in the server.

Use a workProc.  See XtAppAddWorkProc(3Xt).		You should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks (this	is the hard part).  Then, in the callback that starts the drawing,	you call XtAppAddWorkProc() to call your workProc the first time. 	Your workProc should be a function that returns a boolean...	TRUE when you are finished, and FALSE when you want to keep	processing.  If you return FALSE, the workProc is automatically	re-installed.  		Note that this method is better that using a time-out loop, since	events get processed in a more precedence-oriented manner.  If you	are using the same Ada bindings I am, however, you are hosed, and	should look into XtAppAddTimeout(3Xt).		----------	Joe Hildebrand	hildjj@fuentez.com	Software Engineer	Fuentez Systems Concepts	(703)273-1447		Standard disclaimers apply

	Hi, netters:		We have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process	#if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to	true no matter what the conditionals are.	For example, makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributed	by Sun) - namely Xos.h:		#if     !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__)	#       include <string.h>	#       define  index   strchr	#       define  rindex  strrchr	#else   /* BSD && !__STDC__ */	#       include <strings.h>	#endif  /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */		Here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements	to 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist	under Solaris2.	We also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code.	We got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem.		In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (Sun's	distribution) mentions this problem:		BUGS	     If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp,  the  Berkeley  C	     preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way	     that all #if directives will evaluate to  "true"  regardless	     of  their  actual  value.  This may cause the wrong #include	     directives to be evaluated.  Makedepend should  simply  have	     its own parser written for #if expressions.		Has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than	WriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us?		Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply 	directly to my e-mail address -> I'll post a summary.		Thanks in advance.	***************************************************************************	*     Michael Turok                  *                                    *	*  Information Resources, Inc.       * E-Mail:  mlt@blues.infores.com     *	*     200 Fifth Avenue               * Voice:  (617) 890 1100 ext.7531    *	*  Waltham, MA 02154, USA            * Fax:    (617) 890 4660             *	***************************************************************************

Asher                                          		Yes, Xhibition is for the X Window System.  The X Window System Conference 	remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X.  Nineteen full	and half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days	provide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendor	exhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what	folks can purchase today, and you have a complete show focused on X11.		Speakers at Xhibition 93 include: 		  Bob Schiefler, Lu Abel, Mark Ackerman, Paul Asente, Doug Blewett, 	  Donna Converse, Jim Fulton, Oliver Jones, Keith Packard, Ralph Swick, 	  Doug Young, and many others.		Xhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional	conferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of	interest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object	Management Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server	technologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational;	and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT.		With the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing	applications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from a	player as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many	desktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to be	evaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers and	suppliers.		The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information	to the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conference	at Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to provide	the *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX	developers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT has	what you need for your application development or systems deployment, this is	the place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show you	what you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development	Kits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself.		I hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an	Xhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience	is growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is a	confusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all of	the other acronyms sprouting up.

Unfortunately it does.  I don't agree with the logic of NT at an X windows	conference.

It is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need	to be DSC compliant.  That is the fault of the left hand not knowing what the	right hand is doing at Sun.

		Hi all,		I've read the FAQ, I've fiddled around, but I am still having problems getting	my poor old HP9000/300 to let me input/display characters above 127.  I have 	the following in my .Xdefaults:		XTerm*Font     :   -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1		So I believe that I have the correct font selected to use in xterm.  I have NOT	set my LC_CTYPE environment variable because whatever I put it, it tells me that	that locale is not supported (apparently we have no additional locales defined,	or at least, /lib/locale doesn't exist).  I can get some of the characters	above 127 to print out, but they are not where I'd expect them -- for example,	Alt-v does not produce a u umlaut.  This leads me to believe that the fault	lies with the stty settings, which are as follows:		speed 9600 baud; line = 0; susp <undef>; dsusp <undef>	intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^H; kill = ^K; swtch = ^@	eof = ^D; eol = ^@; min = 4; time = 0; stop = ^S; start = ^Q	-parenb -parodd cs8 -cstopb hupcl cread -clocal -loblk -crts 	-ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl -iuclc 	ixon -ixany ixoff -ienqak 	isig icanon iexten -xcase echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh 	opost -olcuc onlcr -ocrnl -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel -tostop 		Anyway, I've struggled with this off and on for a couple of weeks, and any help	anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks Gabi.	      ________________________________________________	     /                                                \	    /      /\                                          \	   / .----/  \----.

HPGL does not support raster primitives, so a formatter would have to 	punt on most popular image formats.  This probably explains the lack of	translators out there.  What do you need to plot ?

From the FAQ:			        In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts	with the way X builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols, notably,	to be undefined when building some X11 clients:	        _get_wmShellWidgetClass	        _get_applicationShellWidgetClass	Compiling "-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic" appears to work.

	Hi,		I am running X11R4 on an IBM RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) and X11R5 on a Sun4 (SunOS 4.1).		Since I run X on both colour and black&white displays, I need different	values for the same resource, so I want to use #ifdef COLOR in my	application defaults files. However, cpp is only invoked by xrdb, and	not when the resources are loaded on demand.		Is there a proper solution to this?		So far, the only proper solution I've come to think of, is to create 2	different files in my ~/app-defaults/, say XTerm and XTerm-color, and	set my XFILESEARCHPATH to either $HOME/%T/%N or $HOME/%T/%N-color.	But that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell	command without reading the .cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH).		Furthermore, I thought of using #include "XTerm" in XTerm-color.	However, for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTerm-color,	things are different on both machines. On a Sun, the FIRST found resource	is used (i.e. the one from XTerm, the b&w one), while on an RS/6000, the	LAST found value is used (i.e. the one from XTerm-color). What can I do	about it?		I have one last question: for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH, I	can use %T, %N, %C and %S. %T stands for app-defaults, %N for the	resource class, but what do %C and %S stand for?

			Help,			I've got an applications with a series of pushbuttons across		the top (a toolbar).

I've done this fine, but I've turned up the following problem:			When the pushbuttons are sensitive I get callbacks on both of		the above events, but when they are not sensitive I only get		callbacks on LeaveWindow events.

A hundred of them on a single ethernet might be	>a problem, but a couple dozen should be fine.		Bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem, except over a wet string network.	One of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions (and	hence process switches) that it forces upon a host.  Actual measurements	(hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user, which can lead to	20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is	filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how	many processes are needed for each character.)		While a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking	process, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like	10 process switches per second per user.  This is a significant increase	in overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large working	set.  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as many	as 50.		If you want to go there, I wouldn't start from here!			Nick Maclaren	University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory,	New Museums Site, Pembroke Street,	Cambridge CB2 3QG, England.

I assume that you are literally trying to create a widget of type	textWidgetClass. Use the AsciiText widget instead.

	I have an application running in one window. In this application,	I'd like to iconize this window, and later deiconize back to window.	How could I do it? Your help would be appreciated.		Tai	thou@siemens.com		
				Bristol Technology announces the availability of 	its HyperHelp(tm) and Xprinter(tm) demo for downloading.		This demo showcases the two products in the form of a 	diagram editor called DE.		Download the demo and see some of these exciting features for yourself:			 o Complete on-line context sensitive help system.			 o Printing support for PCL5 and PostScript.			 o Rotated Text support!			 o Source code for the demo is provided.		The demo is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9).		There are two versions of the demo located in the vendor/Bristol directory:	Sun     - sun4.demo.tar.Z (SunOS 4.x)	HP      - hp700.tar.Z     (HP-UX 8 & 9)		If you have any questions about the demo, send an	e-mail to: support@bristol.com.		If you want another version of the demo (rs6000,etc...) 	please send an e-mail to: info@bristol.com.		Remember to use binary mode!			What are HyperHelp and Xprinter?  Read on......	---------------------------------------------------------	Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of	its popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter.					    HyperHelp 3.0				    -------------	HyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context	sensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one	line function call, application developers can access the	full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on	their development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF,	project, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility.	This allows a documentation department to maintain a single	set of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif and	Open Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. 	And with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler!		New features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character	based viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved History	window.					     Xprinter 2.0				     ------------	Xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated	printer support to their existing/new X based applications	very easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the	display and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code	for drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for	our demo and see Xprinter in action.		If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support	to your application, Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier	this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that	resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology	for UNIX SVR4.2.			Feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about	HyperHelp and Xprinter. 		If you have any questions or comments, send them to us at:	info@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438-6969.						Happy demoing,									The staff at Bristol Technology

	I am working for a company which has only one connection to the Internet.	This is through a firewall gateway (unix workstation). I would like to be	able to telnet to a host outside the company and set the DISPLAY to my PC	which is running an X-terminal emulator (eXceed/W). The display can be set	to the gateway workstation with no problem but when I set the variable to 	my IP address I get a "Error: Can't open display" message. 		This can't be that hard to work around can it?		BTW I have no trouble running x-clients on local workstations (in the company)	and having them display on my PC.	-- 	Curtis Wahlgren                                       		
	Any Tcpview-for-Sun users out there?  I pulled down the pre-compiled	executables made for Sun for Tcpview, but I'm getting a whole slew of the	following types of error messages when I try to start it up:	  Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfActivate	  Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfActivate:ManagerParentActivate()'	  Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfCancel	  Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfCancel:ManagerParentCancel()'	  Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfSelect	  Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfSelect:ManagerGadgetSelect()'	  ...	But I *know* I have those in my keysym:	  egrep "osfActivate|osfCancel|osfSelect" $OPENWINHOME/lib/XKeysymDB	yields:	  osfActivate             :1004FF44	  osfSelect               :1004FF60	  osfCancel               :1004FF69	  osfSelectAll            :1004FF71	and, if I take *out* the osf lines from said XKeysymDB, my copy of wscrawl	(another Motif-compiled-for-Sun program) gives the same type of complaints	as listed above.		Any tips?  I'm mystified.	-- 	Kevin Weinrich     Computer Sciences Corp.	kbw@helios.ath.epa.gov	
		Hello,		I was wondering if anyone knew of an interface to od ( octal dump ), I assume	it would be called xod.  Actually, any viewer for a core file will do.
